Shigekuni’s memories were vague—he just barely recalled having\\nbeen taken once to the front gate to watch a torchlight procession. The year the war\\nended they had both been eleven, and it seemed to Kiyoaki that they should be able to\\nremember it a little more accurately. Their classmates who talked so knowingly about the\\nwar were for the most part merely embellishing hazy memories with tidbits they had\\npicked up from grown-ups.\\nTwo members of the Matsugae family, Kiyoaki’s uncles, had been killed. His\\ngrandmother still received a pension from the government, thanks to these two sons she\\nhad lost, but she never used the money; she left the envelopes unopened on the ledge of\\nthe household shrine. Perhaps that was why the photograph which impressed Kiyoaki\\nmost out of the entire collection of war photographs in the house was one entitled\\n“Vicinity of Tokuri Temple: Memorial Services for the War Dead” and dated June 26,\\n1904, the thirty-seventh year of the Meiji era. This photograph, printed in sepia ink, was\\nquite unlike the usual cluttered mementos of the war. It had been composed with an\\nartist’s eye for structure: it really made it seem as if the thousands of soldiers who were\\npresent were arranged deliberately, like figures in a painting, to focus the entire attention\\nof the viewer on the tall cenotaph of unpainted wood in their midst. In the distance,\\nmountains sloped gently in the haze, rising in easy stages to the left of the picture, away\\nfrom the broad plain at their foot; to the right, they merged in the distance with scattered\\nclumps of trees, vanishing into the yellow dust of the horizon. And here, instead of\\nmountains, there was a row of trees growing taller as the eye moved to the right; a\\nyellow sky showed through the gaps between them. Six very tall trees stood at graceful\\nintervals in the foreground, each placed so as to complement the overall harmony of the\\nlandscape. It was impossible to tell what kind they were, but their heavy top branches\\nseemed to bend in the wind with a tragic grandeur.\\nThe distant expanse of plains glowed faintly; this side of the mountains, the vegetation\\nlay flat and desolate. At the center of the picture, minute, stood the plain wooden\\ncenotaph and the altar with flowers lying on it, its white cloth twisted by the wind.\\nFor the rest you saw nothing but soldiers, thousands of them. In the foreground, they\\nwere turned away from the camera to reveal the white sunshields hanging from their\\ncaps and the diagonal leather straps across their backs.

This light charged the entire picture with an indescribable sense\\nof grief.\\nFrom these men, there emanated a tangible emotion that broke in a wave against the\\nsmall white altar, the flowers, the cenotaph in their midst. From this enormous mass\\nstretching to the edge of the plain, a single thought, beyond all power of human\\nexpression, bore down like a great, heavy ring of iron on the center.\\nBoth its age and its sepia ink tinged the photograph with an atmosphere of infinite\\npoignance.\\n∗\\nKiyoaki was eighteen. Nothing in the household where he had been born would account\\nfor his being so sensitive, so prone to melancholy. One would have been hard pressed to\\nfind, in that rambling house built on high ground near Shibuya, anyone who in any way\\nshared his sensibilities. It was an old samurai family, but Kiyoaki’s father, Marquis\\nMatsugae, embarrassed by the humble position his forebears had occupied as recently as\\nthe end of the shogunate fifty years before, had sent the boy, still a very small child, to\\nbe brought up in the household of a court nobleman. Had he not done so, Kiyoaki would\\nprobably not have developed into so sensitive a young man.\\nMarquis Matsugae’s residence occupied a large tract of land beyond Shibuya, on the\\noutskirts of Tokyo. The many buildings spread out over a hundred acres, their roofs rising\\nin an exciting counterpoise. The main house was of Japanese architecture, but in the\\ncorner of the park stood an imposing Western-style house designed by an Englishman. It\\nwas said to be one of four residences in Japan—Marshal Oyama’s was the first—that one\\nmight enter without removing one’s outdoor shoes.\\nIn the middle of the park a large pond spread out against the backdrop of a hill covered\\nwith maples. The pond was big enough to boat on; it had an island in the middle, water\\nlilies in flower, and even water shields that could be picked for the kitchen. The drawing-\\nroom of the main house faced the pond, as did the banqueting room of the Western\\nhouse.\\nSome two hundred stone lanterns were scattered at random along the banks and on\\nthe island, which also boasted three cranes made out of cast-iron, two stretching their\\nlong necks to the sky and the other with its head bent low.\\nWater sprang from its source at the crest of the maple hill and descended the slopes in\\nseveral falls; the stream then passed beneath a stone bridge and dropped into a pool\\nthat was shaded by red rocks from the island of Sado, before flowing into the pond at a\\nspot where, in season, a patch of lovely irises bloomed. The pond was stocked both with\\ncarp and winter crucian.

Long ago, when his grandfather was ill, a friend had presented him with\\na hundred of these turtles in the hope that their meat would rebuild his strength.\\nReleased into the pond, they had bred rapidly. Once a snapping turtle got your finger in\\nits beak, the servants told Kiyoaki, that was the end of it.\\nThere were several pavilions used for the tea ceremony and also a large billiard room.\\nBehind the main house, wild yams grew thick in the grounds, and there was a grove of\\ncypresses planted by Kiyoaki’s grandfather, and intersected by two paths. One led to the\\nrear gate; the other climbed a small hill to the plateau at its top where a shrine stood at\\none corner of a wide expanse of grass. This was where his grandfather and two uncles\\nwere enshrined. The steps, lanterns, and torii, all stone, were traditional, but on either\\nside of the steps, in place of the usual lion-dogs, a pair of cannon shells from the Russo-\\nJapanese War had been painted white and set in the ground. Somewhat lower down\\nthere was a shrine to Inari, the harvest god, behind a magnificent trellis of wisteria. The\\nanniversary of his grandfather’s death fell at the end of May; thus the wisteria was always\\nin full glory when the family gathered here for the services, and the women would stand\\nin its shade to avoid the glare of the sun. Their white faces, powdered even more\\nmeticulously than usual for the occasion, were dappled in violet, as though some\\nexquisite shadow of death had fallen across their cheeks.\\nThe women. No one could count exactly the multitude of women who lived in the\\nMatsugae mansion. Kiyoaki’s grandmother, of course, took precedence over them all,\\nthough she preferred to live in retirement at some distance from the main house, with\\neight maids to attend to her needs. Every morning, rain or shine, Kiyoaki’s mother would\\nfinish dressing and go at once with two maids in attendance to pay her respects to the\\nold lady. And every day the old lady would scrutinize her daughter-in-law’s appearance.\\n“That hairstyle isn’t very becoming. Why not try doing it in the high-collar way\\ntomorrow? I’m sure it would look better on you,” she would say, her eyes narrowed\\nlovingly. But when the hair was arranged the Western way next morning, the old lady\\nwould comment: “Really, Tsujiko, a high-collar hair-do simply doesn’t suit an old-\\nfashioned Japanese beauty like you. Please try the Marumage style tomorrow.” And so,\\nfor as long as Kiyoaki could remember, his mother’s coiffure had been perpetually\\nchanging.\\nThe hairdressers and their apprentices were in constant attendance. Not only did his\\nmother’s hair demand their services but they had to look after more than forty maids.\\nHowever, they had shown concern for the hair of a male member of the household on\\nonly one occasion. This was when Kiyoaki was in his first year at the middle school\\nattached to Peers School. The honor had fallen to him of being selected to act as a page\\nin the New Year’s festivities at the Imperial Palace.\\n“I know the people at school want you to look like a little monk,” said one of the\\nhairdressers, “but that shaved head just won’t look right with your fine costume today.”\\n“But they’ll scold me if my hair is long.”\\n“All right, all right,” said the hairdresser. “Let me see what I can do to improve it.

When the hairdresser parted his hair, the comb hurt, and the hair oil stung his skin.\\nFor all the hairdresser’s vaunted skill, the head reflected in the mirror looked no different\\nfrom any boy’s, yet at the banquet Kiyoaki was praised for his extraordinary beauty.\\nThe Emperor Meiji himself had once honored the Matsugae residence with his\\npresence. To entertain his Imperial Majesty, an exhibition of sumo wrestling had been\\nstaged beneath a huge gingko tree, around which a space had been curtained off. The\\nEmperor watched from a balcony on the second floor of the Western house. Kiyoaki\\nconfided to the hairdresser that on that occasion he had been permitted to appear before\\nthe Emperor, and His Majesty had deigned to pat him on the head. That had taken place\\nfour years ago, but it nevertheless was possible that the Emperor might remember the\\nhead of a mere page at the New Year’s festivities.\\n“Really?” exclaimed the hairdresser, overwhelmed. “Young master, you mean to say\\nyou were caressed by the Emperor himself!” So saying, he slid backward across the\\ntatami floor, clapping his hands in genuine reverence at the child.\\nThe costume of a page attending a lady of the court consisted of matching blue velvet\\njacket and trousers, the latter reaching to just below the knees. Down either side of the\\njacket was a row of four large white fluffy pompons and more were attached to the cuffs\\nand the trousers. The page wore a sword at his waist, and the shoes on his white-\\nstockinged feet were fastened with black enamel buttons. A white silk tie was knotted in\\nthe center of his broad lace collar, and a tricorn hat, adorned with a large feather, hung\\ndown his back on a silk cord. Each New Year, about twenty sons of the nobility with\\noutstanding school records were selected to take turns—in fours—bearing the train of the\\nEmpress, or in pairs to carry the train of an imperial princess during the three days of\\nfestivities. Kiyoaki carried the train of the Empress once and did the same for the Princess\\nKasuga. When it was his turn to bear the Empress’s train she had proceeded with solemn\\ndignity down corridors fragrant with the musky incense lit by the palace attendants, and\\nhe had stood in attendance behind her during the audience. She was a woman of great\\nelegance and intelligence, but by then she was already elderly, close to sixty. Princess\\nKasuga, however, was not much more than thirty. Beautiful, elegant, imposing, she was\\nlike a flower at its moment of perfection.\\nEven now, Kiyoaki could remember less about the rather sober train favored by the\\nEmpress than about the Princess’s broad sweep of white ermine, with its scattered black\\nspots and its border of pearls. The Empress’s train had four loops for the pages’ hands,\\nand the Princess’s two. Kiyoaki and the others had been so exhaustively drilled that they\\nhad no trouble in holding firm while advancing at a steady pace.\\nPrincess Kasuga’s hair had the blackness and sheen of fine lacquer.

Some way down the corridor, Kiyoaki stumbled\\nfor a moment, inadvertently tugging at the train. The Princess turned her head slightly,\\nand, as a sign that she was not at all annoyed, smiled gently at the youthful offender.\\nHer gesture went unnoticed; body perfectly erect in that fractional turn, she had allowed\\nKiyoaki a glimpse of a corner of her mouth. At that moment, a single wisp of hair slipped\\nover her clear white cheek, and out of the fine-drawn corner of an eye a smile flashed in\\na spark of black fire. But the pure line of her nose did not move. It was as if nothing had\\nhappened . . . this fleeting angle of the Princess’s face—too slight to be called a profile—\\nmade Kiyoaki feel as if he had seen a rainbow flicker for a bare instant through a prism of\\npure crystal.\\nHis father, Marquis Matsugae, watched his son’s part in the festivities, absorbing the\\nboy’s brilliant appearance in his beautiful ceremonial costume, and savoring the\\ncomplacency of a man who sees a lifelong dream fulfilled. This triumph dispelled\\ncompletely his lingering fears of still seeming an imposter, for all his attempts to establish\\nhimself as someone fit to receive the Emperor in his own home. For now, in the person of\\nhis own son, the Marquis had seen the ultimate fusion of the aristocratic and the samurai\\ntraditions, a perfect congruence between the old court nobles and the new nobility.\\nBut as the ceremony continued, the Marquis’s gratification at the praise people had\\nlavished on the boy’s looks changed to feelings of discomfort. At thirteen, Kiyoaki was\\naltogether too handsome. Putting aside natural affection for his own son, the Marquis\\ncould not help noticing that he stood out even in comparison with the other pages. His\\npale cheeks flushed crimson when he was excited, his brows were sharply defined and his\\nwide eyes, still childishly earnest, were framed by long lashes. They were dark and had a\\nseductive glint in them. And so the Marquis was roused by the flood of compliments to\\ntake note of the exceptional beauty of his son and heir, and he sensed something\\ndisquieting in it. He was touched by an uneasy premonition. But Marquis Matsugae was\\nan extremely optimistic man, and he shook off his discomfiture as soon as the ceremony\\nwas over.\\nSimilar apprehensions were more persistent in the mind of young Iinuma, who had\\ncome to live in the Matsugae household as a boy of seventeen the year before Kiyoaki’s\\nservice as a page. Iinuma had been recommended as Kiyoaki’s personal tutor by the\\nmiddle school of his village in Kagoshima, and he had been sent to the Matsugaes with\\ntestimonies to his mental and physical abilities. The present Marquis’s father was revered\\nas a fierce and powerful god in Kagoshima, and Iinuma had visualized life in the\\nMatsugae household entirely in terms of what he had heard at home or at school about\\nthe exploits of the former Marquis.

Kiyoaki, who had an\\naversion to anything smacking of militarism, had come to loathe school for this reason.\\nHis only friend was his classmate Shigekuni Honda. There were of course many others\\nwho would have been delighted to be friends with Kiyoaki, but he didn’t like the youthful\\ncoarseness of his contemporaries; he shunned their rough, coltish ways and was further\\nrepelled by their crude sentimentality when they mindlessly roared out the school song.\\nKiyoaki was drawn only to Honda, with his quiet, composed, rational temperament,\\nunusual in a boy of his age. Even so the two had little in common in appearance or\\ntemperament.\\nHonda seemed older than he was. Though his features were quite ordinary, he tended\\nto assume a somewhat pompous air. He was interested in studying law, and was gifted\\nwith keen intuition, but it was a power he tended to disguise. To look at him was to\\nbelieve that he was indifferent to sensual pleasures, but there were times when he\\nseemed fired by some deep passion; at these moments, Honda—who always kept his\\nmouth firmly shut, as he kept his somewhat near-sighted eyes severely narrowed and his\\nbrows in a frown—was to be caught with a hint of parted lips in his expression.\\nKiyoaki and Honda were perhaps as different in their makeup as the flower and the leaf\\nof a single plant. Kiyoaki was incapable of hiding his true nature, and he was defenseless\\nagainst society’s power to inflict pain. His still unawakened sensuality lay dormant within\\nhim, unprotected as a puppy in a March rain, body shivering, eyes and nose pelted with\\nwater. Honda, on the other hand, had quite early in life grasped where danger lay,\\nchoosing to shelter from all storms, whatever their attraction.\\nDespite this, however, they were remarkably close friends. Not content to see each\\nother in school, they would also spend Sundays together at one or the other of their\\nhomes.

Just below him, he could see the boats moored in a small inlet.\\nAt the same time, he was mulling over his friend’s lack of enthusiasm. Kiyoaki never\\ntook the lead, though sometimes he would join in with an air of utter boredom only to\\nenjoy himself in his own way. The role of exhorter and leader, then, always fell to Honda\\nif the pair were to do anything at all.\\n“You can see the boats, can’t you?” said Kiyoaki.\\n“Yes, of course I can,” Honda replied, glancing dubiously behind him.\\n∗\\nWhat did Kiyoaki mean by his question? If one were forced to hazard a guess, it would\\nbe that he was trying to say that he had no interest in anything at all. He thought of\\nhimself as a thorn, a small, poisonous thorn jabbed into the workmanlike hand of his\\nfamily. And this was his fate simply because he had acquired a little elegance. A mere\\nfifty years before, the Matsugaes had been a sturdy, upright samurai family, no more,\\neking out a frugal existence in the provinces. But in a brief span of time, their fortunes\\nhad soared.

He was, in fact, a young man who wanted\\nto lead a constructive life, and he had made up his mind about his future role. With\\nKiyoaki, however, he always took care to seem less sensitive and subtle than he was. For\\nhe knew that his friend was quite receptive to his careful displays of obtuseness—the only\\nbait that seemed to draw a rise from Kiyoaki. And this streak of deception ran through\\ntheir whole friendship.\\n“It would do you good to get some exercise,” said Honda brusquely. “I know that you\\ncan’t have been reading all that much, but you look as if you’d read your way through a\\nlibrary.”\\nKiyoaki smiled by way of reply. Honda was right. It was not his books that had drained\\nhim of energy but his dreams. A whole library wouldn’t have exhausted him as much as\\nhis constant dreaming night after night.\\nThe very night before, he had dreamed of his own coffin, made of unpainted wood. It\\nstood in the middle of an empty room with large windows, and outside, the pre-dawn\\ndarkness was shading to a deep blue; it was filled with the sound of birdsong. A young\\nwoman clung to the coffin, her long black hair trailing from her drooping head, her\\nslender shoulders wracked with sobs. He wanted to see her face but could make out no\\nmore than her pale, graceful forehead with its delicate peak of black hair. The coffin was\\nhalf covered with a leopard-skin bordered in pearls. The first muted glow of the dawn\\nflickered on the row of jewels. Instead of funeral incense, a scent of Western perfume\\nhung over the room with the fragrance of sun-ripened fruit. Kiyoaki seemed to be\\nwatching this from a great height, though he was convinced that his body lay inside the\\ncoffin. But sure as he was, he still felt the need to see it there by way of confirmation.\\nHowever, like a mosquito in the morning light, his wings lost all power and ceased\\nbeating in mid-air; he was utterly incapable of looking inside the nailed-down coffin lid.\\nAnd then, as his frustration grew more and more intense, he woke up.

As the prow shivered the brilliant scarlet surface of the water, the smooth\\nripples heightened Kiyoaki’s sense of liberation. The dark water seemed to speak in a\\ndeep, solemn voice. “My eighteenth autumn, this day, this afternoon, this moment: never\\nto come again,” he thought, “something already slipping irrevocably away.”\\n“Shall we take a look at the island?”\\n“What’s the fun in that?

It was a peaceful, uneventful,\\nglorious Sunday afternoon. Yet Kiyoaki remained convinced that at the bottom of this\\nworld, which was like a leather bag filled with water, there was a little hole, and it\\nseemed to him that he could hear time leaking from it, drop by drop.\\nThey reached the island at a spot where a single maple stood among the pines, and\\nclimbed the stone steps to the grassy clearing at the top with the three iron cranes. The\\nboys sat down at the feet of the pair that were stretching their necks upward in an\\neternal, mute cry, then lay back on the grass to stare up at the late autumn sky. The\\nrough grass pricked through the backs of their kimonos, making Kiyoaki rather\\nuncomfortable. It gave Honda, however, the sensation of having to endure an exquisitely\\nrefreshing pain that was fragmented and spread out under his back. Out of the corners of\\ntheir eyes, they could see the two cranes, weathered by wind and rain and soiled by\\nchalky-white bird droppings. The birds’ supple, curved necks, stretched against the sky,\\nmoved slowly with the rhythm of the shifting clouds.\\n“It’s a beautiful day. In all our lives, we may not have many like this—so perfect,” said\\nHonda, stirred by some premonition.\\n“Are you talking about happiness?” asked Kiyoaki.\\n“I don’t remember saying anything about happiness.”\\n“Well, that’s all right then.

As she crossed the white sand to walk along\\nthe water’s edge, it shone pale and silky like the sky at daybreak. The women’s laughter,\\ncarrying on the autumn air, betrayed her uncertain footing on the irregular stepping-\\nstones, but it rang too pure and sounded a little artificial. It always irritated Kiyoaki to\\nhear the women of the household laughing like that, but he was well aware of the effect\\nit had on Honda, who had a glint in his eye like a rooster alerted to the clucking of hens.\\nThe brittle stalks of dry autumn grass bent under their chests.\\nKiyoaki felt sure that the girl in the pale-blue kimono would never laugh that way.

We have nothing but men,”\\nsaid Honda, putting a good face on his interest, which was keen enough to make him get\\nup and move to the other side of the island. Here, from the shelter of the pines, he was\\nable to follow the awkward progress of the women. To the left of him, a hollow in the\\nslope held the first four of the nine waterfalls. The stream then followed the curve of the\\nhill and finally splashed down in front of it into the pool below the red Sado rocks.

Aware that Kiyoaki’s high spirits were by now a reflex response to the interruption\\nof his dreams, Honda did not mind his friend seizing the initiative.\\n“Who is it?”\\n“Oh, it’s Satoko. Did I never show you her picture?” answered Kiyoaki, speaking her\\nname with cool indifference. Satoko, the girl on the shore, was certainly a beauty.\\nKiyoaki, however, seemed determined to ignore this. For he knew that Satoko was in love\\nwith him.\\nThis instinctive rejection of anyone who showed him affection, this need to react with\\ncold disdain, were a failing of Kiyoaki’s that no one could have known better than Honda,\\nwho saw this pride as a kind of tumor that had taken hold of Kiyoaki when he was no\\nmore than thirteen and had first had to endure people making a fuss over his looks. Like\\na silvery bloom of mold, it would spread at the slightest touch.\\nPerhaps, in fact, the dangerous attraction that Kiyoaki’s friendship held for Honda was\\nrooted in the same impulse. So many others had attempted to befriend Kiyoaki, only to\\nbe rewarded for their pains with his mockery and contempt. In challenging Kiyoaki’s\\ncaustic reserve, Honda alone had been skilled enough to escape disaster. Perhaps he was\\nmistaken, but he wondered if his own acute dislike for Kiyoaki’s gloom-faced tutor sprang\\nfrom the latter’s expression of perpetual defeat.\\nAlthough Honda had never met Satoko, Kiyoaki’s stories were full of her. The Ayakura\\nfamily, one of twenty-eight among the nobility that bore the lofty rank of Urin, was\\ndescended from an ancestor named Namba Yorisuke, a skilled player of \\nkemari\\n, the\\nversion of football popular at the Imperial Court in the time of the Fujiwaras. The head of\\nthe family was appointed a chamberlain of the Imperial Court when it established\\nresidence in Tokyo at the time of the Meiji Restoration. The Ayakuras moved to the city\\nand lived in a mansion in Azabu formerly occupied by one of the retainers of the shogun.\\nThe family excelled in the sport of \\nkemari\\n and in composing \\nwaka.\\n And since the Emperor\\nhad seen fit to honor the family’s young heir with a court rank of “fifth degree, junior\\ngrade,” even the post of Grand Councillor of State now seemed within reach.\\nMarquis Matsugae, who was conscious of his own family’s lack of polish and who hoped\\nto give the next generation at least a touch of elegance, had entrusted the infant Kiyoaki\\nto the Ayakuras after obtaining his own father’s consent. And so Kiyoaki had been raised\\nin the atmosphere of the court nobility with Satoko, who was two years older and\\nlavished affection on him; until he went to school, she was his only companion and friend.\\nCount Ayakura himself, a warm and personable man who still retained his soft Kyoto\\naccent, taught the young Kiyoaki calligraphy and \\nwaka.\\n The family would play \\nsugoroku\\n,\\nan ancient form of backgammon, far into the night, as was the custom in the Heian era,'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'calibre 1.43.0 [http://calibre-ebook.com]', 'creator': 'calibre 1.43.0 [http://calibre-ebook.com]', 'creationdate': '2014-09-08T21:10:44+00:00', 'author': 'Yukio Mishima', 'title': 'Spring Snow', 'source': '../data/pdfFiles/Spring Snow - Yukio Mishima.pdf', 'total_pages': 273, 'page': 20, 'page_label': '21'}, page_content='and the lucky winners would receive traditional prizes, among them candies molded like\\ngifts from the Empress.\\nMoreover, Count Ayakura arranged for Kiyoaki to continue his early cultural training by\\ngoing to the palace each New Year to attend the Imperial Poetry Reading Ceremony, in\\nwhich he himself figured prominently. At first, Kiyoaki had seen this as a chore, but as he\\ngrew older, his participation in these elegant and ancient rituals came to hold a certain\\ncharm for him.\\nSatoko was now twenty. And thumbing through Kiyoaki’s picture album, one could see\\nthe changes as she grew to maturity, from when she was a child with her cheek pressed\\naffectionately to Kiyoaki’s until the previous May, when she had taken part in the\\nMatsugae Omiyasama festival. At twenty she had passed the stage that was popularly\\nsupposed to mark a girl’s greatest beauty, but she was still unmarried.\\n“So that’s Satoko. And the other one, the woman in the gray tunic everyone’s making\\nsuch a fuss over, who’s she?”\\n“Her? Oh yes; that’s Satoko’s great-aunt, the Abbess of Gesshu. I didn’t recognize her\\nat first because of that curious hood.”\\nHer Reverence the Abbess was indeed an unexpected guest. This was her first visit to\\nthe Matsugaes, hence the conducted tour of the garden—something that Kiyoaki’s mother\\nwould not have undertaken just for Satoko but was quite happy to do for the Abbess. Her\\ngreat-aunt’s visit to Tokyo being such a rarity, Satoko had no doubt brought her to see\\nthe maple leaves. The Abbess had taken great delight in Kiyoaki when he first came to\\nthe Ayakuras, but he could not remember that far back. Later, when he was in middle\\nschool and the Abbess had paid a visit to Tokyo, he had been invited to the Ayakuras, but\\nhe had had the opportunity to do no more than pay his respects. Even so, the Abbess’s\\npale face with its air of quiet dignity and the calm authority in her voice had made a\\nlasting impression on him.\\nKiyoaki’s voice had brought the group on the shore to an abrupt halt. Startled, they\\nlooked toward the island as if pirates had risen before their very eyes from the tall grass\\nbeside the decorative iron cranes.\\nPulling a small fan from her obi, Kiyoaki’s mother pointed toward the Abbess to indicate\\nthat a respectful greeting was expected. Kiyoaki, accordingly, made a deep bow from\\nwhere he stood on the island. Honda quickly followed suit, and Her Reverence\\nacknowledged them both. His mother then opened her fan and waved it imperiously, its\\ngolden sheen suddenly giving off scarlet reflections. Kiyoaki urged Honda to hurry up,\\nknowing that they must come back from the island at once.\\n“Satoko never misses a chance to come here. She’s taking advantage of her great-\\naunt,” grumbled Kiyoaki with a show of bad temper, while helping Honda by hurrying to\\ncast off the boat. Honda, however, viewed Kiyoaki’s haste and his grumbling with some\\nskepticism. The way Kiyoaki had lost patience with Honda’s steady, methodical\\nmovements and had seized the rough rope in his own unseasoned white hands to try to\\nhelp with the unpleasant task of unknotting it was enough to raise doubts about the\\nAbbess being the cause of his eagerness.\\nAs Honda rowed back to the shore, Kiyoaki looked dizzy, his face picking up a red flush'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'calibre 1.43.0 [http://calibre-ebook.com]', 'creator': 'calibre 1.43.0 [http://calibre-ebook.com]', 'creationdate': '2014-09-08T21:10:44+00:00', 'author': 'Yukio Mishima', 'title': 'Spring Snow', 'source': '../data/pdfFiles/Spring Snow - Yukio Mishima.pdf', 'total_pages': 273, 'page': 21, 'page_label': '22'}, page_content='from the reflection of the maple leaves floating on the water.

Yet her expression was a façade rather than a true indication of\\nher deeper emotions. She was in fact almost invariably insensitive. She had raised\\nKiyoaki to tolerate his father’s dissipation and boorish energy, but she was quite\\nincapable of grasping the complexities of her son’s nature.\\nSatoko’s eyes were riveted on Kiyoaki from the moment he stepped out of the boot.\\nStrong and calm, affectionate from time to time, they invariably unnerved Kiyoaki. He\\nfelt, not without reason, that he could read criticism in their glance.\\n“Her Reverence has honored us with a visit today, and we shall shortly have the\\npleasure of listening to her speak. But first we wanted to show her the maple leaves.\\nThen you gave us such a fright by that rude shout of yours.

And what’s there to see in the sky?”\\nHis mother was quite unembarrassed about her failure to grasp the intangible, which\\nstruck him as her sole admirable characteristic. He found it comical that she could adopt\\nsuch a pious expression for the Abbess’s sermons. The Abbess maintained her role of\\nguest throughout this exchange, smiling unassumingly. And he would not look at Satoko,\\nwho gazed steadily at the thick, glossy, tousled black hair that brushed his smooth\\ncheeks.\\nThe group now started up the steep path, admiring the maples as they went and\\namusing themselves by trying to identify the birds singing in the branches above their\\nheads.

And the\\nladies gasped as if they were noticing the dog for the first time.\\nKiyoaki’s pride was hurt. Satoko, with a boldness that might be construed as\\nunfeminine, had pointed out the dog’s corpse, ignoring its ominous implications. She had\\nadopted a suitably pleasant and straightforward tone of voice, which bore witness to her\\nelegant upbringing; she had the freshness of ripe fruit in a crystal bowl.

If you will bury the dog under a\\nmound, I’ll offer a prayer for it.”\\nThe dog had probably been mortally sick or wounded when it came to the stream to\\ndrink, and had fallen in. The force of the current had wedged its corpse into the cleft of\\nrocks at the top of the falls.

His\\ncompanion, eighteen like himself and also his best friend, was his cousin Prince Kridsada,\\na grandson of King Rahma IV, whose titular name was Mon Chao. Prince Pattanadid\\nnicknamed him “Kri.” But Prince Kridsada, in deference to Pattanadid’s place in the\\nsuccession, addressed him more respectfully as “Chao P.”\\nBoth princes were fervently devout Buddhists. But they not only dressed for the most\\npart like young English gentlemen, they also spoke the language with perfect fluency.\\nIndeed it was precisely because the new king had been concerned about their becoming\\ntoo Westernized that he had decided upon Japan for their university studies. Neither of\\nthe princes had raised any objections, despite one unfortunate aspect to it. Leaving Siam\\nentailed the separation of Chao P. and Kri’s younger sister.\\nThe love of these two young people for each other was the delight of the court, since\\ntheir engagement at the end of Chao P.’s studies was a foregone conclusion and their\\nfuture was secure in every way. Yet when he sailed, Chao P.’s grief was so intense as to\\ngive rise to alarm in a country whose customs did not favor such direct expressions of\\nfeeling.\\nThe sea voyage and his cousin’s sympathy had helped considerably to alleviate the\\nyoung prince’s distress, and when they arrived for a stay at the Matsugaes’, Kiyoaki found\\ntheir swarthy faces alight with happiness.\\nThe princes were free to follow the school routine as they liked until the winter holidays\\nbegan. Though they were to start attending classes in January, it was decided that they\\nwould not be officially enrolled until the new term began in the spring, by which time they\\nwould have had the chance to acclimatize and also to study the language intensively.\\nWhile they were at the Matsugaes’, the princes were to occupy two adjoining guest\\nrooms on the second floor of the Western-style house, which had been equipped with a\\nsteam-heating system imported from Chicago. The period before dinner with the\\nassembled Matsugae family was awkward for Kiyoaki and his guests, but when the three\\nyoung men were left to themselves after the meal, stiff formality suddenly eased as the\\nprinces began to show Kiyoaki photographs of the golden temples and exotic scenery of\\nBangkok.

But the rather\\nstrong brows over wide, timid eyes, the lips slightly parted like the petals of an exotic\\nflower before the rains come—her features all gave the unmistakable impression of girlish\\ninnocence unconscious of its own beauty. Of course that had its charm, but much like a\\nyoung nestling quite oblivious of its power to fly, she was too passively content.\\n“Compared with this girl,” Kiyoaki thought, “Satoko is a hundred, a thousand times\\nmore of a woman. And isn’t that why she is often so hateful to me—because she is so\\nmuch a woman? Besides, she’s far more beautiful than this girl. And she knows how\\nbeautiful she is.

As he did so, Kiyoaki’s eye was caught\\nby a flash of green, and for the first time he noticed Chao P.’s beautiful ring. Its stone was\\na rich, square-cut emerald. On either side of it, the fierce beasts’ heads of a pair of\\nyaksha, the warrior gods, had been finely etched in gold. All in all, it was an immense\\nring of such quality that for Kiyoaki to have overlooked it until now was proof of how little\\nhe was inclined to take notice of others.\\n“I was born in May. It’s my birthstone,” Prince Pattanadid explained, slightly\\nembarrassed again. “Ying Chan gave it to me as a farewell present.”\\n“But if you wore something as magnificent as that at Peers, I’m afraid they’d order you\\nto stop,” warned Kiyoaki.\\nTaken aback by this, the two princes began to confer earnestly in their native\\nlanguage, but quickly realizing their inadvertent rudeness, they switched back to English\\nfor Kiyoaki’s sake.

From the day of the Abbess of Gesshu’s sermon, he had become more\\nand more aware of such a system’s inadequacies.\\nHe realized, however, that although natural law had been comparatively neglected in\\nrecent years, no other system of thought displayed such a capacity for survival: it had\\nflourished in different forms suited to each of the many epochs in two thousand years of\\nhistory—from its apparent origins in Socrates and its powerful influence on the\\nformulation of law in the Roman era through the medium of Aristotle’s writings, to its\\nintricate development and codification during the Christian Middle Ages and its renewed\\npopularity in the Renaissance; this indeed reached such a peak that the period could be\\ncalled the Age of Natural Law. In all probability, it was this recurrent philosophy that\\npreserved the traditional European faith in the power of reason. Still, Honda could not\\nhelp thinking that despite its tenacity, two thousand years of its strong, bright, Apollonian\\nhumanism had barely sufficed to hold off the assaults of darkness and barbarism.\\nNor was the assault limited to these forces. Another, more blinding light had also\\nthreatened it, since natural law had to rigidly exclude the very possibility of a concept of\\nexistence based on romantic and irrational nationalism.\\nHowever that might be, Honda did not necessarily cling to the historical school of law,\\nwhich was influenced by nineteenth-century romanticism, nor to the ethnic school. The\\nJapan of the Meiji era, indeed, needed a nationalistic type of law, one that had its roots\\nin the philosophy of the historical school. But Honda’s concerns were quite different. He\\nhad first been intent on isolating the essential principle behind all law, a principle which\\nhe felt must exist. And this was why the concept of natural law had fascinated him for a\\ntime. But now he was more concerned to define the outer limits of natural law, which\\nwere inadvertently pointed up by its claims to universality. He enjoyed giving his\\nimagination free rein in this direction. If the law, he thought, was to do away with the\\nrestrictions that natural law and philosophy had imposed upon man’s vision of the world\\nsince ancient times, and break through to a more universal principle (granted that such\\nexists) would it not reach a stage where the law itself, as we know it, would cease to\\nexist?'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'calibre 1.43.0 [http://calibre-ebook.com]', 'creator': 'calibre 1.43.0 [http://calibre-ebook.com]', 'creationdate': '2014-09-08T21:10:44+00:00', 'author': 'Yukio Mishima', 'title': 'Spring Snow', 'source': '../data/pdfFiles/Spring Snow - Yukio Mishima.pdf', 'total_pages': 273, 'page': 44, 'page_label': '45'}, page_content='This was, of course, the kind of dangerous thinking that appealed to youth. And given\\nHonda’s circumstances, with the geometrical structure of Roman law towering so\\nformidably in the background to cast its shadow over the modern operative law that he\\nwas now studying, it was no wonder that he found its orthodoxy rather tedious; from time\\nto time, he therefore put aside the legal codes of Meiji Japan, so scrupulously based on\\nWestern models, and turned his eyes in another direction—to the broader and more\\nancient legal traditions of Asia.\\nIn his present skeptical mood, a French translation by Delongchamps of the Laws of\\nManu, which had arrived from Maruzen at an opportune moment, contained much that he\\nfound strongly appealing.\\nThe Laws of Manu, probably compiled over the period from 200 \\nB.C.\\n to 200 \\nA.D.,\\n were\\nthe foundation of Indian law. And among faithful Hindus, it maintained its authority as a\\nlegal code right up to the present. Within its twelve chapters and 2,684 articles were\\ngathered an immense body of precepts drawn from religion, custom, ethics, and law. It\\nranged from the origin of the cosmos to the penalties for robbery and the rules for\\ndividing an inheritance. It was imbued with an Asian philosophy in which all things were\\nsomehow one, in remarkable contrast to the natural law and world view of Christianity,\\nwith its passion for making distinctions based on a neatly corresponding macrocosm and\\nmicrocosm.\\nHowever, the right of action in Roman law embodied a principle that contradicted the\\nmodern concept of rights. Just as Roman law held that rights lapse when there is no\\npossibility of redress, so too the Laws of Manu, according to the procedural rules in force\\nin the great courts of the rajahs and Brahmins, restricted the suits that might be brought\\nto trial to cases of nonpayment of debts and some eighteen others.\\nHonda was fascinated by the uniquely vivid style of the Laws. Even details as prosaic\\nas court procedure were couched in colorful metaphors and similes. During the conduct of\\na trial, for example, the rajah was to determine the truth and falsehood of the matter\\nbefore him “just as the hunter searches out the lair of the wounded deer by following the\\ntrail of blood.” And in the enumeration of his duties, the rajah was admonished to\\ndispense favors on his people “as Indra lets fall the life-giving rain of April.” Honda read\\nright to the very end, including the final chapter, which dealt with arcane matters that\\ndefied classification either as laws or as proclamations.\\nThe imperative postulated in Western law was inevitably based on man’s power of\\nreason. The Laws of Manu, however, were rooted in a cosmic law that was impervious to\\nreason—the doctrine of the transmigration of souls. This was set out in the Laws as a\\nmatter of course:\\n“Deeds proceed from the body, speech, and the mind, and result in either good or evil.”\\n“In this world, the soul in conjunction with the body performs three kinds of act: good,\\nindifferent, and evil.”\\n“That which proceeds from a man’s soul shall shape his soul; that which proceeds from\\nhis speech shall shape his speech, and deeds that proceed from his body shall shape his\\nbody.”\\n“He who sins in body shall be a tree or grass in the next life, he who sins in speech'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'calibre 1.43.0 [http://calibre-ebook.com]', 'creator': 'calibre 1.43.0 [http://calibre-ebook.com]', 'creationdate': '2014-09-08T21:10:44+00:00', 'author': 'Yukio Mishima', 'title': 'Spring Snow', 'source': '../data/pdfFiles/Spring Snow - Yukio Mishima.pdf', 'total_pages': 273, 'page': 45, 'page_label': '46'}, page_content='shall be a bird or a beast, and he who sins in soul shall be reborn at the lowest level of\\ncaste.”\\n“The man who retains a proper guard over his speech, his mind, and his body with\\nregard to all living things—the man who bridles his lust and his anger—shall achieve\\nfulfillment. Total liberation shall be his.”\\n“It is fitting that every man should employ his inherent wisdom to discern how the fate\\nof his soul depends on his adherence or nonadherence to the law and that he should\\nexert himself wholeheartedly in the faithful observance of the law.”\\nHere, just as in the natural law, to observe the law and to do good deeds were taken\\nas being the same thing. But here the law was based upon the principle of the\\ntransmigration of souls, a doctrine that short-circuited normal rational inquiry. And rather\\nthan making an appeal to human reason, the Laws seemed to play on the threat of\\nretribution. And thus as a doctrine of law, it placed somewhat less trust in human nature\\nthan did the Roman law with its reliance on the powers of reason.\\nHonda had no desire to spend his time mulling over the problem like this, or to steep\\nhimself in the wisdom of the ancients. Being a law student, he was inclined to support the\\nestablishment of law, but he was persistently troubled by doubts and misgivings about\\nthe operative system that was his subject. His struggles with its painfully intricate and\\ntangled structure had taught him that a broader view was sometimes necessary; this was\\nto be found not only in natural law, with its apotheosis of reason that was at the heart of\\noperative law, but also in the seminal wisdom of the Laws of Manu. From this vantage\\npoint, he could enjoy two worlds—the clear blue of midday or the star-filled night.\\nThe study of law was certainly a strange discipline. It was a net with mesh so fine as to\\ncatch the most trivial incidents of daily life, yet its vast extension in time and space\\nencompassed even the eternal movements of the sun and stars. No fisherman seeking to\\nincrease his catch could be more greedy than the student of law.\\nLost for so long in his reading and oblivious to the passage of time, Honda at last\\nrealized with some anxiety that he had better go to bed if he was not to look exhausted\\nwhen he met Kiyoaki at the Imperial Theater the next night. When he thought of his\\nfriend, so handsome and so hard to fathom, and then considered how unlikely it was that\\nhis own future would be anything but ordinary and predictable, he could not suppress a\\nslight shudder. He idly turned over in his mind the triumphs with which his classmates so\\nproudly regaled him, such as using a rolled-up cushion to play rugby in a Gion teahouse\\nwith a flock of young geishas.\\nThen he thought of an episode in his own home this spring that would have been\\ninsignificant in a more worldly environment but which set off immense reverberations in\\nthe Honda household.

When he\\nbrooded over his frustrating circumstances, he did so with a chill resentment quite\\ndifferent from the hot anger he had once felt. Of course the atmosphere of the Matsugae\\nhousehold, so unfamiliar to him, had had much to do with the changes in him. From the\\nvery beginning, however, the main source of contagion had been Kiyoaki, now eighteen\\nyears old.\\nThe boy would be nineteen this coming year. If Iinuma could only see to it that he\\ngraduated from Peers with good marks and then that he was entered in the law school of\\nTokyo Imperial University when the autumn of his twenty-first year came round, he would\\nbe able to feel that his own responsibility had been properly discharged. However, for\\nsome reason that Iinuma could not fathom, Marquis Matsugae had never seen fit to take\\nhis son to task over his school record. And as things stood now, there seemed little\\nchance of Kiyoaki’s studying law at Tokyo University. After graduating from Peers, there\\nseemed to be no other course open to him but to take advantage of his privileges as a\\nmember of the nobility and enter either Kyoto or Tohoku Imperial University without\\nhaving to take an entrance examination. Kiyoaki’s performance at school had been\\nindifferent; he put no effort into his studies, nor did he compensate for this at all by trying\\nto shine at athletics instead. Had he been an outstanding student, Iinuma could have\\nshared in the glory, giving his friends and relatives in Kagoshima cause to be proud. But\\nby now, Iinuma could only dimly recall the fervent hopes he had once entertained. And\\nbesides, he realized bitterly, no matter how far short of the mark Kiyoaki fell, he was still\\nassured of a seat in the House of Peers.\\nThe friendship between Kiyoaki and Honda was another source of irritation. Honda was\\nclose to the top of his class, but he made no attempt to influence his friend for the good,\\ndespite Kiyoaki’s regard for him; quite the reverse, in fact.

By a sort of confused intuition of which he\\nhimself was unaware, he grasped something of the nature of Kiyoaki’s almost\\nimpenetrable isolation. Kiyoaki’s determination, in turn, to keep his distance from Iinuma,\\ndoubtless sprang from the fact that he perceived all too clearly the nature of his tutor’s\\nburning fanaticism.\\nOf all the retinue in the Matsugae household, only Iinuma was possessed by this fervor,\\nsomething intangible yet quite apparent as soon as one looked into his eyes. One day, a\\nguest asked: “Excuse me, but that houseboy of yours isn’t a socialist, is he?” The Marquis\\nand his wife could not help bursting into laughter at this, for they were well aware of\\nIinuma’s background, his present behavior, and, above all, the zeal with which day in, day\\nout, he performed his devotions at the “Omiyasama” shrine. It was customary for this\\ntaciturn young man, who had no words to waste on anyone, to go to the family shrine\\nearly each morning; there he poured out his heart to Marquis Matsugae’s renowned\\nfather, whom he had never known in his lifetime. In the early days, his pleas were shot\\nthrough with a radical anger, but as he grew older, they began to be shaped by a\\npervasive discontent that now had spread to envelop every aspect of his world.\\nHe was the first to rise every morning. He washed his face and rinsed out his mouth,\\nthen putting on his indigo-striped kimono and his \\nOkura hakama\\n, he set off in the\\ndirection of the shrine.\\nHe walked along the path that led past the maids’ quarters at the rear of the main\\nhouse and through the grove of Japanese cypresses. In cold weather, like this morning’s,\\nthe frost tortured the dirt of the path into tiny spiral mounds; when these were crushed\\nby the blunt impact of Iinuma’s wooden clogs, they shattered into pure, glittering\\nfragments. The morning sun, lying bright and gauzy over the withered brown and green\\nleaves that still clung to the cypresses, shone on his frosty breath rising in the winter air.\\nHe felt utterly purified. Incessant birdsong filled the pale blue morning sky. However,\\ndespite the stimulation of the cold air briskly striking his bare skin under his open-necked\\nkimono, something wrung his heart with bitter regret: “If only the young master would\\ncome with me, just once!”\\nHe had never succeeded in communicating this vigorous, masculine sense of well-being\\nto Kiyoaki. No one could hold him responsible for this failure. To force the boy to\\naccompany him on these morning walks was out of the question, yet Iinuma continued to\\nblame himself. In six years he had not been able to persuade Kiyoaki to participate even\\nonce in this “virtuous practice.”\\nOn the flat crest of the small hill, trees gave way to a fairly broad clearing of grass,\\nnow brown and dry, through which a gravel path led to the shrine. As Iinuma gazed at it\\nand the full force of the morning sun struck the granite torii in front of it and the two\\ncannon shells to either side of its stone steps, a feeling of self-possession came over him.\\nHere in the dawn, he found a bracing air of purity, free from the stifling luxury\\npenetrating the Matsugae household.

You once cut men down with your sword, you were wounded by the\\nswords of others, you endured the most terrible dangers—all to found a new Japan.

Some twenty\\nor more people came from Kagoshima, and after going to the residence of the traditional\\nhead of the clan to pay their respects, they were entertained at the Matsugaes’. The New\\nYear’s dinners, cooked in the Hoshigaoka style and served in the black-beamed main hall,\\nwere famous, largely because of such desserts as ice cream and melon, which were\\ndelicacies almost never tasted by country people. This year, however, because the period\\nof mourning for the Meiji Emperor was not yet over, no more than three guests came up\\nfrom Kagoshima; among them, the principal of Iinuma’s middle school, a gentleman who\\nhad the honor of having known Kiyoaki’s grandfather.\\nMarquis Matsugae had established a certain ritual with the old teacher. As Iinuma\\nwaited on him at the banquet, the Marquis would speak graciously to the old man:\\n“Iinuma has done well here.” This year, too, the formula had been invoked, and the\\nprincipal had murmured the usual politely deprecating words, as predictably as someone\\nstamping his seal on a routine document. But this year, perhaps because there was only\\na handful of guests present, the ceremony struck Iinuma as being insincere, a perfunctory\\nformality.\\nOf course Iinuma had never presented himself to any of the illustrious ladies who came\\nto call on the Marquise, so he was taken aback at being confronted in his young master’s\\nstudy by a New Year’s guest who happened to be a woman, however elderly.\\nTadeshina wore a black kimono patterned with crests, and though she sat upright in\\nher chair with extreme propriety, the whiskey that Kiyoaki had urged on her had evidently\\ntaken some effect. Beneath her graying hair, gathered neatly into a knot and still\\nunruffled, the skin on her forehead glowed through the layer of white makeup with a\\nshade of snow-covered plum blossom.\\nAfter acknowledging Iinuma with a brief glance, she returned to the story she had been\\ntelling about Prince Saionji.\\n“According to what everyone said, the Prince enjoyed tobacco and alcohol from the age\\nof five onward.

For\\nafter all, their children receive the court rank of fifth degree at birth, which qualifies them\\nto become retainers of His Imperial Majesty, and so out of reverence to the Emperor,\\ntheir parents don’t dare to be harsh with them. And in a court nobleman’s house, nobody\\nsays anything about his Imperial Majesty that isn’t absolutely prudent. Just as nobody\\nbelonging even to the household of a lord would ever dare to gossip openly about their\\nmaster. And that’s the way it is. And my mistress too has this same deep reverence for\\nHis Imperial Majesty. But of course it doesn’t extend to foreign lords.” This last was\\nTadeshina’s ironic jab at the hospitality extended to the Siamese princes by the\\nMatsugaes. Then she hastened to make some amends: “But then, thanks of course to\\nyour great kindness, I was privileged to see a play again after I don’t know how long. I\\nfelt that it gave me a new lease on life.”\\nKiyoaki let Tadeshina ramble on as she liked. In asking her to come to his study, he\\nhad had something quite definite in mind. He wanted to be free of the nagging doubt that\\nhad pursued him ever since that night. And so now, after plying Tadeshina with more\\nwhiskey, he asked her abruptly if Satoko had in fact taken his letter and thrown it\\nunopened into the fire as requested.\\nHer answer came more readily than he might have expected: “Oh that! The young lady\\nspoke to me immediately after her telephone conversation with you. So when the letter\\ncame next day, I took it and burned it unopened. Everything was taken care of. You need\\nnot worry about it at all.”\\nOn hearing this, Kiyoaki felt like a man who has struggled for hours through tangled\\nundergrowth and at last fights his way into the open. A multitude of delightful prospects\\nunfolded before his eyes. Satoko’s not having read the letter did two things: not only did\\nit restore things to their former balance, but Kiyoaki was now happily confident that he\\nhad opened up a whole new perspective on life.\\nSatoko had already made an overture whose implications were dazzling. Her annual\\nNew Year’s visit to exchange greetings fell on a day traditionally set aside by the Marquis\\nfor the children of his relatives. They would gather at his house, their ages ranging from\\nthree to twenty. And on this one day he would don the role of loving father, listening\\nkindly to what each of them had to say and giving counsel when called upon to do so.\\nThis year, Satoko had brought some children out to see the horses.\\nKiyoaki led them to the stable where the Matsugaes kept their four horses. It was\\ndecorated for the holidays with the twisted rope traditional in Shinto observance. The\\nhorses, with their powerful, smooth-muscled bodies, suddenly rearing back or kicking\\ntheir hooves against the boards, struck Kiyoaki as having a pulsating life appropriate to\\nthe New Year. The children were enthralled. They asked the groom for each horse’s\\nname. Then, taking aim at the huge yellow teeth, they hurled salvos of squashed pieces\\nof crumbling candy they had been clutching in their fists.

Kiyoaki\\nwalked over to join her, leaving the children to the groom.\\nHer eyes were showing the effects of the spiced saké that was traditional at New Year\\ncelebrations. What she said, therefore—to the accompaniment of the children’s shouts of\\njoy—might have been attributed to this stimulus. At any rate, as Kiyoaki came to her\\nside, she looked at him far from demurely and began to speak with a lilt of excitement in\\nher voice.\\n“I was so happy that night, you know. You introduced me as though I were your\\nfiancée. I’m sure Their Highnesses were quite surprised that I should be so old. But do\\nyou know how I felt then? If I had had to die at that very moment, I would have had no\\nregrets. My happiness lies in your hands. Be careful with it, won’t you? I’ve never been so\\nhappy at a New Year as I am now. I never looked forward so much to what the year may\\nbring.”\\nKiyoaki did not know what to say. “Why are you telling me all this?” he asked finally, in\\na strained voice.\\n“Oh, Kiyo, when I’m very happy, my words come tumbling out like the doves they\\nrelease at a launching, flying up through a burst of confetti. Kiyo, you’ll understand soon\\nenough.” To make matters worse, Satoko had ended on that phrase calculated to irritate\\nKiyoaki: “You’ll understand soon enough.”\\n“How proud and self-satisfied she is!” thought Kiyoaki. “So much older and wiser.”\\nAll this had taken place some days before. And now today, after Tadeshina’s account of\\nthe fate of the letter, Kiyoaki lost his lingering misgivings, now confident that he was\\nembarking on a New Year under the most favorable auspices. He would be rid of the\\nmelancholy dreams that had plagued his nights. He was determined that from now on his\\ndreams would be happy. His manner would never fail to be open, and since he would be\\nfree of depression and worry, he would try to communicate his own well-being to\\neveryone. But dispensing goodwill to mankind is a hazardous business at best, and one\\nthat demands a considerable degree of maturity and wisdom. Nevertheless, Kiyoaki was\\ndriven by an extraordinary sense of urgency.\\nWhatever his sense of mission, however, he had not called Iinuma to his room solely\\nout of the warm desire to dispel his tutor’s gloom and see his face transformed with\\nhappiness.\\nThe saké he had drunk combined with something else to provoke Kiyoaki to rashness.\\nTadeshina, despite her selfabashing manner and excruciating courtesy, had a certain air\\nabout her that put one in mind of the proprietress of a brothel, albeit one with an ancient\\nand honorable reputation. An unmistakable distilled sensuality seemed to cling to the\\nvery wrinkles of her face. And having her so close at hand aroused Kiyoaki’s natural\\nwillfulness.\\n“As far as schoolwork goes, Iinuma has taught me all sorts of things,” said Kiyoaki,\\ndeliberately directing his remarks exclusively at Tadeshina. “Still, there are a number of\\nthings he didn’t teach me. Actually, the truth is that there are many things that Iinuma\\ndoesn’t know.

Since Kiyoaki had not indicated\\nthat he might take a seat, he continued to stand, looking out over the pond. The day was\\novercast, and a flock of ducks swam near the island, from which the dark green crowns of\\nthe pines rose, cold and forbidding. The rough brown grass that covered the island\\nreminded Iinuma of a farmer’s straw raincoat.\\nFinally, at a word from Kiyoaki, Iinuma sat down stiffly in a chair. Until then, Kiyoaki\\nhad not appeared to notice him standing by the door, which seemed extremely odd to\\nhim. Perhaps, he thought, his master was making a show of his authority in front of\\nTadeshina. If so, it was something new in Kiyoaki, which pleased him.\\n“Well now, Iinuma, let’s see. Tadeshina here has just been gossiping with our maids.\\nAnd just by chance she happened to hear . . .”\\n“Young master, please! Don’t.” Waving her arms in a show of frantic distress,\\nTadeshina tried to stop him, but to no avail.\\n“She happened to hear that the maids are convinced that when you go to the shrine\\nevery morning, you have more on your mind than mere devotion.”\\n“More on my mind, master?” Iinuma’s face muscles tightened and his clenched hands\\nresting in his lap began to tremble.\\n“Please, young master,” wailed Tadeshina, “don’t go into it with him.” She slumped\\nback in her chair like a carelessly dropped porcelain doll, but despite her manifestations\\nof acute distress, there was a faint but unmistakable gleam in her deep-set eyes. And the\\nlines around her mouth, with its badly fitting false teeth, were slack, witnesses to past\\nsensuality.\\n“To reach the shrine, you have to pass the rear wing of the house, don’t you? Which\\nmeans, of course, that you walk right past the windows of the maids’ quarters. And on\\nyour way every morning, you’ve also been exchanging looks with Miné. And finally, just\\nthe other day, you slipped her a note through the lattice. Or so they say. Is it true or isn’t\\nit?”\\nBefore Kiyoaki had finished, Iinuma was on his feet. His pale face was contorted in rigid\\ndesperation as he struggled to control himself. It was as though a white heat were\\nbuilding within him, ready to explode into a terrible inferno. Kiyoaki was delighted by the\\nlook on his face, which was transformed from the dull phlegmatic expression he was used\\nto. Though Iinuma was obviously in agony, to Kiyoaki his face, contorted into an ugly\\nmask, was happy.\\n“If the master will be good enough to excuse me now . . . ,” said Iinuma, making a\\nrapid turn toward the door.

I was sitting on a splendid chair in the middle of a room. I seemed to be held\\nthere, unable to move. Throughout the dream, I felt as if I had a headache. And this was\\nbecause I was wearing a tall, pointed gold crown set with all sorts of precious stones.\\nAbove my head, a huge flock of peacocks were perched on a maze of beams just under\\nthe roof. And from time to time white droppings fell on my crown.\\nOutside the sun was scorching. It was beating down in a desolate garden run wild.\\nEverything was still, except for the faint droning of flies and the occasional thud of the\\npeacocks’ feet on the beams above or sometimes the rustling of their wings. The garden\\nwas surrounded by a high stone wall, but there were large openings like windows let into\\nit. And through these I could see the trunks of palm trees and, behind them, piled-up\\nwhite clouds, dazzling and unmoving.\\nThen I looked down at my hand and saw that I was wearing an emerald ring. This, of\\ncourse, was Chao P.’s, but somehow it had been placed on my finger. The design was\\ncertainly the same—the two weird faces of the guardian gods, the yaksha, carved into the\\ngold on either side of the stone.\\nI stared at the ring glinting in the sun pouring in from outside, my eyes held by a pure,\\nflawless white light that sparkled like frost crystals in the center of the emerald. And as I\\ndid so, I became aware of the face of a woman, young and beautiful, which had gradually\\nformed within it. I turned around, thinking that it was the reflection of someone behind\\nme, but there was no one there. Now the face in the emerald moved slightly and its\\nexpression changed. Where it had been serious, it was now smiling. At that moment, the\\nback of my hand began to itch as one of the swarm of flies hovering above me settled on\\nit.

This sort of devotion was enough to satisfy Kiyoaki and, furthermore,\\nmade him wonder if such a thing as friendship was really so important. And in the\\nmeantime, without being wholly aware of it, he was growing apart from Honda. This\\nsaddened Honda, but he had always been keenly aware that he was only a marginal\\nnecessity in Kiyoaki’s life. He thus knew that their relationship had lacked an element\\nvital to friendship. The time he would have spent in idleness with Kiyoaki, therefore, he\\nnow spent on his books. Besides his study of law in German, French, and English, he read\\nwidely in literature and philosophy.

His melancholy expression and bearing had not\\nundergone any change, but his present obsequiousness robbed them of their power to\\nannoy Kiyoaki.\\nHe had, he said, just received a phone call from Tadeshina. The message was simply\\nthis: Satoko was so delighted by the snow that she would like Kiyoaki not to go to school,\\nand come for a rickshaw ride through the snow with her instead.\\nNo one had ever made so startlingly capricious a request of Kiyoaki. Ready for school,\\nhe stood with his book bag in his hand, appalled, and stared at Iinuma.\\n“What’s this? Miss Satoko really suggested something like that?”\\n“Yes, sir. I heard it directly from Miss Tadeshina. There can be no mistake.”\\nCuriously enough, as he confirmed this, Iinuma seemed more like his former\\nindependent self, and he looked ready to lecture Kiyoaki if challenged about it.\\nKiyoaki gave a quick glance over his shoulder at the garden, where snow was falling.\\nThis time, Satoko’s forceful methods did not wound his pride. On the contrary, he felt a\\nsense of relief, as though her scalpel had skillfully cut out a malignant tumor of\\narrogance. Since the surgery was over before he knew it, this bypassing of his own\\nwishes gave him a kind of keen pleasure. “I’ll do just as she wants,” he said, gazing out\\nthoughtfully at the thickly falling snow.

Take us anywhere you can go,” said Kiyoaki in answer to the\\nrickshaw man.

Since he would not look at Satoko, there was nothing else to do\\nbut stare out at the snow, flashing brightly through the narrow window of yellow celluloid.\\nFinally, however, he put his hand under the blanket, where Satoko’s was waiting, already\\nin possession of the one warm, narrow refuge available.\\nOne of the snowflakes blew in and lodged itself on Kiyoaki’s eyebrow. It made Satoko\\ncry out, and without thinking, Kiyoaki turned toward her as he felt a cold trickle on his\\neyelid. She closed her eyes abruptly. Kiyoaki stared at the face with its closed lids; only\\nthe subdued crimson of her lips glowed in the shadows, and because of the swaying of\\nthe rickshaw, her features, like a flower held between trembling fingertips, were softly\\nblurred.\\nKiyoaki’s heart thumped violently.

He realized that she was telling him something, and so, despite\\nhis terrible sense of vulnerability, he felt that something gentle but irresistible was\\ndrawing him on. He pressed a kiss on her lips.\\nA moment later, the shaking of the rickshaw was about to force their lips apart, but\\nKiyoaki instinctively resisted the movement, until his whole body seemed to balance on\\nthat kiss, and he had the sensation that a huge, invisible, perfumed fan was slowly\\nunfolding where their lips met.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'calibre 1.43.0 [http://calibre-ebook.com]', 'creator': 'calibre 1.43.0 [http://calibre-ebook.com]', 'creationdate': '2014-09-08T21:10:44+00:00', 'author': 'Yukio Mishima', 'title': 'Spring Snow', 'source': '../data/pdfFiles/Spring Snow - Yukio Mishima.pdf', 'total_pages': 273, 'page': 66, 'page_label': '67'}, page_content='At that instant, although totally engrossed, he was still keenly aware of his own good\\nlooks.

All that was divisive and frustrating sprang from\\nsomething alien to beauty. Kiyoaki now realized that a fanatical insistence on total\\nindependence was a disease, not of the flesh but of the mind.\\nOnce his anxiety had been erased and he felt increasingly sure of the girl who was the\\nsource of his happiness, their kiss became increasingly, passionately intense; Satoko’s lips\\nwere growing more pliant, and then just as he began to fear that his very essence might\\nbe melted and drawn into the sweet fragrance of her mouth, his fingertips stirred with the\\ndesire to touch her flesh. He pulled his hand out from under the blanket and passed it\\naround her shoulders to hold her chin. He felt the small, fragile bones of a woman’s jaw\\nwith his fingertips and so gained a renewed awareness of a physical presence quite\\noutside his own. This realization, however, only intensified the passion of his kiss.\\nSatoko had begun to cry, as he realized when her tears wet his own cheeks. He felt a\\nsurge of pride, which owed nothing to his recent mood of altruism, the complacent desire\\nto benefit mankind that had seized him; and in the same way, Satoko’s manner had lost\\nall trace of her former condescension, so like that of a critical older sister.

The edge of the slope was skirted by a field that allowed a clear view of the\\nparade ground and barracks of the Azabu Third Regiment below. On the white expanse of\\nparade ground, there was not one soldier to be seen. Suddenly Kiyoaki had the illusion of\\nseeing a huge mass of troops drawn up, just as in the familiar picture of the memorial\\nceremony near Tokuri Temple for the fallen of the Russo-Japanese War. With bowed\\nheads, thousands of soldiers stood in groups around a white wood cenotaph and an altar\\ncovered with white cloths that were blowing in the wind. This scene differed from the\\nphoto only insofar as the soldiers’ shoulders were covered with snow and the visors of\\ntheir caps had turned white.

The thousands of troops below had massed not only to\\npray for fallen comrades, but to mourn their own lives as well.\\nIn a moment, the phantoms were gone.

Looking at you always makes me ponder that question.\\nYou’re not a great man and you’re not a genius either. But, nonetheless, you have one\\ncharacteristic that sets you quite apart: you have no trace whatever of willpower. And so\\nI am always fascinated to think of you in relation to history.”\\n“Are you being sarcastic?”\\n“No, not a bit. I’m thinking in terms of unconscious participation in history. For\\nexample, let’s say that I have will-power—”\\n“You certainly have.”\\n“Say that I want to alter the course of history. I devote all my energies and resources\\nto this end. I use every ounce of strength I possess to bend history to my will. Say I\\npossess the prestige and authority so necessary to bring this about. None of this would\\nensure that history proceeded according to my wishes. Then, on the other hand, perhaps\\na hundred, two hundred, even three hundred years later, history might veer abruptly to\\ntake a course that was consonant with my vision and ideals—and this without my having\\nhad anything whatever to do with it. Perhaps society would assume a form that was the\\nexact replica of my dreams of a hundred or two hundred years before; history, enjoying\\nthe new glory that had been my vision, would smile at me with cool condescension and\\nmock my ambition. And people would say: ‘Well, that’s history.’”\\n“But there is such a thing as the time being ripe for everything, isn’t there?” asked\\nKiyoaki. “Your vision’s time would finally have come, that’s all. Maybe it wouldn’t even\\ntake as long as a hundred years; maybe thirty or fifty.

But here were gathered the Chinese classics that had belonged to Kiyoaki’s\\ngrandfather, the Western books that the Marquis had ordered from Maruzen out of the\\ndesire to appear intellectual, and many others received as gifts. When Kiyoaki started\\nhigh school, his father had handed over the key with the pomposity of one conferring the\\nguardianship of a treasure trove of wisdom. Thus he alone was privileged to go there\\nwhenever he liked. Among the books in the library least likely to excite the Marquis’s\\ninterest were many collections of Japanese classics and children’s books. Prior to\\npublication, each of their publishers had requested a brief recommendation from the\\nMarquis together with a photograph of him in formal dress, and then in exchange for this\\nprivilege to print “Recommended by His Excellency Marquis Matsugae” in gilt letters on\\nthe binding of each book, they presented him with the collections.\\nKiyoaki himself was not inclined to make frequent use of the library. He preferred his\\nown reveries to books. For Iinuma, however, who was given the key once a month by\\nKiyoaki so that he could clean the room, the library was the most hallowed place in the\\nhouse, sanctified as it was by the Chinese classics dear to Kiyoaki’s grandfather. When he\\nspoke of it, he never referred to it merely as the library. It was always “His Late\\nExcellency’s Library,” and when he pronounced those words, his voice was choked with\\nemotion.\\nOn the evening after Kiyoaki had become reconciled with Honda, he called his tutor to\\nhis room just as Iinuma was about to leave for his night classes, and dropped the library\\nkey into his hand without a word. There was a set day for the monthly cleaning.\\nFurthermore, this was a job that Iinuma never did at night.

It lay on\\nthe palm of his thick, blunt hand, blue and metallic like a dragonfly with its wings torn off.\\nAfterwards Iinuma would recall this moment time and again.

Cherry trees\\nwere scattered among the pines in the long rows of trees that flanked the drive to the\\nmain gate for more than half a mile. The best view was from the second-floor balcony of\\nthe Western-style house. Standing there, one could take in all the cherry blossoms on the\\nMatsugae estate in a single sweeping glance; some bloomed along the drive, several\\ntrees stood among the huge gingko trees in the front garden, some ringed the small\\ngrassy knoll where Kiyoaki’s Otachimachi ritual had taken place, and a few grew on the\\nmaple hill beyond the pond. Many discriminating viewers preferred this arrangement to\\nan overwhelming display of massed blossoms in the middle of a garden.\\nFrom spring to early summer, the three principal events in the Matsugae household\\nwere the Doll Festival in March, the cherry blossom viewing in April, and the Shinto\\nfestival in May. But since the prescribed year of mourning following the death of His\\nImperial Highness had not yet elapsed, it was decided that this year the March and April\\nfestivals would be curtailed to strictly family observances—much to the disappointment of\\nthe women in the house. For throughout the winter, as happened every year, all sorts of\\nrumors had been filtering down from the quarters of the senior staff about plans for the\\nDoll Festival and the blossom viewing—such as the story that a troupe of professional\\nentertainers would be brought in. The house was always full of such tales, the kind of\\nspeculation that gave a thrill to simple souls accustomed to making a great deal out of\\nthe arrival of springtime. To have their expectations blighted in this way seemed like a\\nblight on spring itself.\\nThe full Kagoshima-style celebration of the Doll Festival at the Matsugaes’ was\\nrenowned; thanks to appreciative foreign visitors invited in years gone by, it was now\\nfamous abroad as well, so much so in fact that every year, a large number of Americans\\nand Europeans who were in Japan at the festival time would use whatever influence they\\nhad to try to obtain invitations.\\nThe pale cheeks of the two ivory dolls representing the Emperor and Empress shone\\ncold in the early spring light, despite the gleam of the surrounding candles and the\\nreflection from the scarlet carpet beneath. The Emperor doll was dressed in the splendid\\nceremonial robes of a Shinto high priest, and the Empress in the extravagantly rich Heian\\ncourt costume.

He was happiest in the midst of\\nextravagance and ostentation, and the restraints of polite society weighed heavily on his\\noutgoing nature.

She made the sarcastic\\ncomment that its destruction had marked the beginning of the decline of the family. This\\nwas one opinion, however, that was congenial to his own way of thinking. He liked the\\nword “decline.”\\n“If your two uncles were alive, your father wouldn’t be carrying on the way he does. As\\nfar as I’m concerned, this being on familiar terms with the Imperial Family and pouring\\nout money on entertainment is just a big show.

It\\nseems to me that His Imperial Majesty gave it to me for the sake of my sons and the\\nblood they shed so gallantly. It would be wrong ever to use it.”\\nHis grandmother enjoyed delivering herself of little sermons like this, but the truth was\\nthat the Marquis was unstintingly generous in granting whatever she wished, be it\\nclothes, food, spending money, or servants.

Her forehead jutted\\nout sharply under the line of her short hair which she wore bound and sprinkled with a\\nblack powder dye. He noticed the healthy sheen of her skin.

His criterion was to invite the\\nnumber of suitable guests most appropriate to the occasion, as the banquet that\\nconcluded it would be graced by the august presence of the Imperial Prince and his wife.\\nBesides Satoko and her parents, Count and Countess Ayakura, he therefore included only\\nthe two Siamese princes and Baron Shinkawa and his wife, who were frequent visitors\\nand great friends of the Matsugaes. The Baron was the head of the Shinkawa \\nzaibatsu.\\nHis whole way of life was modeled on that of the complete English gentleman, whom he\\ncopied with scrupulous attention to detail. The Baroness, for her part, was on intimate\\nterms with such people as the noted feminist Raicho Hiratsuka and her circle, and was\\nalso a patron of the Women of Tomorow. She could thus be relied upon to add a touch of\\ncolor to the gathering.\\nPrince Toin and his wife were to arrive at three in the afternoon and be shown around\\nthe garden after a short rest in one of the reception rooms of the main house. They\\nwould then be entertained until five o’clock at a garden party by some geishas, who\\nwould go on to perform a selection of cherry blossom dances from the Genroku era.\\nJust before sunset, the imperial couple were to retire to the Western-style house for\\naperitifs. After the banquet itself, there would be a final entertainment: a projectionist\\nhad been hired to show a new foreign film. Such was the program devised by the Marquis\\nwith the help of Yamada, his steward, after pondering the varied tastes of his guests.\\nTrying to settle the choice of films gave the Marquis some agonizing moments. There\\nwas the one from Pathé featuring Gabrielle Robin, the famous star of the Comédie\\nFrançaise, that was indisputably a masterpiece. The Marquis rejected it, however, fearing\\nthat it might destroy the mood of the blossom viewing, created with such care. At the\\nbeginning of March the Electric Theater in Asakusa had begun to show films made in the\\nWest, the first of which, \\nParadise Lost\\n, had already become wildly popular. But it would\\nhardly do to present a film that was readily available in a place like that. Then there was\\nanother film, a German melodrama filled with violent action, but that could hardly be\\nexpected to score a success with the Princess and the other ladies in waiting. The\\nMarquis finally decided that the choice most likely to please his guests was an English\\nfive-reeler based on a Dickens novel. The film might be rather gloomy, but it did have a\\ncertain refinement, its appeal was fairly wide, and the English captions would help all his\\nguests.\\nBut what if it rained?

When all is said and done, I suppose a kimono would be the wisest.\\nPerhaps I should hurry and put in an order at Kitaide in Kyoto and have something made\\nup, perhaps in that lovely blossoms-by-firelight pattern? But for some reason I never look\\nwell in a Suso pattern. I’m never sure if it’s just me who thinks that the Suso pattern\\nlooks frightful on me and that it’s really just the thing, or whether other people also think\\nit looks frightful. So I just don’t know what to do—but what do you think I should do?”\\nOn the day itself, the Shinkawas received a note from the Matsugaes. They were\\nrespectfully requested to arrive some time before the time set for the imperial couple’s\\narrival, and although they chose with cool deliberation to make their appearance five or\\nsix minutes after the time the Toinnomiyas were expected, they were chagrined to\\ndiscover that they were still early. The Marquis had apparently allowed for such\\nmaneuvers. This display of country manners ruffled the Baron.\\n“Perhaps His Imperial Highness’s horses had a stroke on the way,” he observed by way\\nof a greeting. But no matter how biting the Baron’s sarcasm, his speech was mumbled\\nand his expression blank in true English fashion, so that no one heard him.\\nA dispatch from the distant main gate announced the appearance of the imperial\\ncarriage, and the host and his party immediately took up their positions at the entrance\\nof the main house to welcome the Prince.\\nHis carriage was splattered here and there with spring mud as the horses, the gravel\\nspurting under their hooves, trotted up under the pine tree that stood in the drive in front\\nof the house. They snorted irritably and tossed their heads, and for a moment their flying\\ngray manes made Kiyoaki think of the seething crest of a huge wave about to break on\\nthe shore. At the same instant, the imperial chrysanthemum on the door blurred in a\\nwhirlpool of gold and then was still as the carriage came to a halt.\\nPrince Toin’s fine gray moustache was well set off by a black derby. The Princess,\\nfollowing her husband, walked into the entranceway, crossing the threshold onto the\\nwhite carpeting that had been spread over the floors of the main house that morning to\\nobviate the necessity of changing into slippers. The imperial couple naturally gave a brief\\nnod before entering the house, but the formal ritual of welcome was to be enacted in the\\nreception room.\\nAs the Princess passed him, Kiyoaki’s eye was caught by the black tips of her shoes\\nflashing beneath the frilly white material of her skirt. They were like pods of seaweed, he\\nthought, bobbing in a rippling eddy. The elegance of it so fascinated him that he was\\neven more reluctant to look up at her face, which was beginning to show signs of age.\\nIn the reception room, Marquis Matsugae presented the other guests to the\\nToinnomiyas. The only person who was new to them was Satoko.\\n“What have you been up to, Ayakura,” the Prince chided her father, “hiding such a\\nbeautiful young lady from me?”\\nKiyoaki, standing to one side, was seized by a slight shudder that he could not explain.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'calibre 1.43.0 [http://calibre-ebook.com]', 'creator': 'calibre 1.43.0 [http://calibre-ebook.com]', 'creationdate': '2014-09-08T21:10:44+00:00', 'author': 'Yukio Mishima', 'title': 'Spring Snow', 'source': '../data/pdfFiles/Spring Snow - Yukio Mishima.pdf', 'total_pages': 273, 'page': 91, 'page_label': '92'}, page_content='He felt that Satoko had suddenly been transformed into a rare work of art on public\\ndisplay.\\nSince the Prince was so close to the court of Siam, the two princes had been presented\\nto him immediately on arrival in Japan.

Before that he kept his mistress in the same\\nhouse as his wife, but afterwards he installed her in a rented house just outside the front\\ngate, which is about half a mile from the house. That amounts to, say, one half-mile of\\nWesternization. It’s what I believe is called six of one, half a dozen of the other.”\\n“To be enlightened at all,” replied his wife, launching out, “one must be enlightened all\\nthe way. Half measures just won’t do. If the household is really to be run on European\\nlines, then whether it’s a matter of replying to a formal invitation or merely going out for\\na short evening stroll, husband and wife should do it together as we do, regardless of\\nwhat others say. Oh, look over there! See how the hill’s reflected in the pond, with two or\\nthree cherry trees and the red and white curtain? Isn’t it pretty? And do you like my\\nkimono? Looking at what the other ladies are wearing, I’d say that mine has the most\\nelaborate, the boldest, the most enlightened pattern here. And so how gorgeous it would\\nlook to someone on the other side who saw it reflected in the water, don’t you think? Oh,\\nhow frustrating! Why can’t I be on both sides of the pond at once? One is so frightfully\\nlimited, isn’t one, don’t you think?”\\nPairing each husband with his own wife was an exquisitely refined torture that the\\nBaron endured with cheerful equanimity. It was, after all, one that he preferred and had,\\nin fact, pioneered. He looked on it as the kind of ordeal that might well become general\\npractice in advanced civilization a hundred years hence.

A big cherry tree stood here, its\\ntrunk thick enough to give some protection from prying eyes. Kiyoaki stepped through the\\ncurtain and waited behind the tree.

If only Iinuma had been capable of\\nforgetting the master-retainer relationship at that moment, and had put his hand on\\nKiyoaki’s shoulder like an elder brother, how easily he could have started to talk.\\nHe had no idea that the young man who sat in front of him was different from the\\nIinuma to whom he was accustomed. What he did not realize was that the Iinuma who\\nhad once been obsessed with the rough suppression of his own passions had now\\ndeveloped a gentle forbearance toward him, and, inexperienced as he was, had taken his\\nfirst tentative steps into the world of subtle emotions.\\n“I can hardly imagine that you have the least idea what’s on my mind,” Kiyoaki said at\\nlast. “Miss Satoko insulted me terribly.

She came at me with everything that would hurt me\\nmost, as though she had had it all carefully planned. I just don’t understand how she\\ncould have brought herself to do it. Now I realize that the ride that snowy morning—\\nwhich was her idea—now I know that I was nothing more than a toy she felt like playing\\nwith.” Kiyoaki paused for a moment. “But you had no inkling at all of how things really\\nstood? Tadeshina, for example, didn’t say anything at all that sounded suspicious?”\\nIinuma thought for a while before answering.\\n“Well, no, sir. I haven’t heard anything.” But his awkward pause clung to Kiyoaki’s\\nnerves like a vine.\\n“You’re lying. You do know something.”\\n“No, sir, I don’t.”\\nFinally, however, under the pressure of Kiyoaki’s questions, Iinuma poured out what he\\nhad been determined not to reveal.

To\\nselect a bride for such a paragon, his father did not require anyone’s mediation, and so a\\nvast array of candidates had been brought directly to the young man’s attention. None of\\nthese, however, had struck his imperial fancy. Thus the years went by, and just when his\\nimperial parents were at their wits’ end, Marquis Matsugae took a chance and invited\\nthem to the cherry blossom celebration at his estate. There Satoko Ayakura was casually\\npresented to them. The imperial couple were quite taken with her, and when the\\nAyakuras later received a confidential request for a photograph, they hastily obeyed by\\nsending a picture of her in a formal kimono. When Prince Harunori’s parents showed it to\\nhim, he did not make his usual derogatory remarks, but stared at it for some considerable\\ntime. Satoko’s advanced age of twenty-one became a matter of no consequence.\\nMarquis Matsugae was well aware of the debt he owed the Ayakuras for having taken\\ncare of Kiyoaki as a child and he had long been anxious to do something to help the\\nCount’s family regain something of its former grandeur. The best way to achieve this,\\nshort of a marriage into the Emperor’s immediate family, would be a marriage that united\\nthe Ayakuras with one of the princes, and the flawless lineage of the Ayakuras as a noble\\nUrin family precluded any question of status being an obstacle. What the Ayakuras did\\nlack, however, was the financial means for the incredible expenses they would incur in\\ntheir new position. These ranged from a huge dowry to the money that would have to be\\ndisbursed regularly for the traditional seasonal gifts to all the retainers of the imperial\\nhousehold, an appalling sum to consider. The Marquis, nevertheless, was prepared to\\nunderwrite the cost in all particulars.\\nWith cool composure, Satoko watched the bustle as these events went on around her.\\nThere was very little sun in April that year, and as one dark day gave way to another\\nbeneath the overcast sky, the fresh imprint of spring faded, to be replaced by the signs of\\napproaching summer. Satoko looked out over the wide, neglected garden from a bay\\nwindow of her austere room in the handsome, old-fashioned mansion that now retained\\nits pretensions only in its imposing gate. She saw how the camellia blossoms had already\\nfallen and new buds were pushing out from the thick dark clusters of leaves.

But behind the screen of gentle compliance, Satoko was hiding an indifference\\nas vast as the gray April sky.\\nOne day early in May, Satoko was invited to tea at the summer villa of Their Imperial\\nHighnesses, Prince and Princess Toin. Ordinarily, an invitation should have come from the\\nMatsugaes by this time of year to attend their Omiyasama festival, but although all her\\nhopes were now centered on it, it did not come. In its place, an official of the Prince’s\\nhousehold appeared bearing the invitation to tea, handed it casually to a steward of the\\nAyakuras, and departed.\\nDespite the semblance of complete naturalness that attended this and similar\\nincidents, they were in fact carefully plotted in the deepest secrecy, and though her\\nparents said little, they were supporting the conspirators in their attempt to ensnare\\nSatoko in the complex spell that was stealthily being woven around her.\\nThe Count and Countess, of course, were also invited to tea at the Toinnomiya villa.\\nSince it seemed that to go in a carriage sent by the Prince with all its appropriate\\ntrappings would be to create too much of a spectacle, the Ayakuras decided they would\\nrather ride in one kindly lent by Marquis Matsugae.

Since Boys’ Day was approaching, nearly every house\\nthey passed along the way had hoisted its cloth or paper carps, one for each son, and\\nthey were flapping vigorously in the stiff south breeze. They ranged in size from huge\\nblack carp to tiny red ones that looked like goldfish. If five or more were hanging from the\\nsame staff, they seemed to bunch awkwardly together, unable to swim freely in the\\nwind’s powerful current. When the carriage passed one farmhouse on the edge of the\\nmountains, the school of carp above the roof was so vast that the Count was moved to\\nraise a white forefinger to count them from the window. There were ten in all.\\n“My, what a vigorous sort of fellow!” said the Count with a smile. To Satoko, this\\nremark smacked of a vulgar humor uncharacteristic of her father.\\nThe trees along the way bore evidence of a remarkable surge of growth with their\\nclusters of new leaves and branches. The mountains were a mass of green that ranged\\nfrom a near yellow to a dark tone verging on black. The bright young maple leaves stood\\nout especially against the general outpouring of green that made the whole countryside\\nglitter.\\n“Oh, a bit of dust . . .,” the Countess exclaimed, gazing at Satoko’s cheek. But just as\\nshe reached out with her handkerchief to wipe it off, Satoko drew quickly away and the\\nspeck of dust vanished.

He greeted his father with a\\nmilitary salute, and the immediate impression he gave Satoko was one of empty dignity.\\nBut how obvious the paternal pride of Prince Toin was in this display of military pomp,\\nand how evident the young prince’s conviction that he was fulfilling every detail of his\\nfather’s projected image of him. The truth was that his two older brothers were, in fact,\\nquite different. Unusually effeminate and sickly, they had been the despair of their\\nimperial father.\\nToday, however, a touch of embarrassment at being confronted for the first time with\\nSatoko’s beauty may perhaps have had some effect on Prince Harunori’s subsequent\\nbehavior. At any rate, neither when she was presented to him nor at any time thereafter\\ndid he look at her directly.\\nThough the young prince was not particularly tall, he had an impressive physique. He\\nmoved briskly at all times, with an air of importance and decision that lent him a gravity\\nextraordinary in one so young—all of which his father watched, complacent and happy,\\nhis eyes narrowed with pleasure. This paternal satisfaction, however, was giving rise to a\\ngrowing impression among many that Prince Toin himself concealed a certain weakness\\nof will beneath that grand and impressive exterior.\\nAs for hobbies, His Imperial Highness Prince Harunori was devoted to his record\\ncollection of Western music.

When his mother asked: “Would you play something for us, Harunori?” he was\\nquick to agree and to turn toward the reception room, where the phonograph stood.\\nAs he did so, Satoko could not resist raising her eyes to watch him.

They were so dazzling that she\\nimagined she could even see patches of the sky itself reflected in them like fragments of\\nblue porcelain. She closed her eyes and waited for the music to begin. She felt the first\\nstirrings of ominous premonition, and the faint sound of the phonograph needle falling\\ninto place echoed like thunder in her ears.\\nAfterwards, the young prince contributed little to the casual conversation that followed\\nthe musical interlude.

When he went to Kiyoaki’s room for his formal\\nfarewell, he was crying. Kiyoaki could not accept even such grief for what it was. The\\nthought that Iinuma was emphasizing his fervently exclusive loyalty to him gave him no\\npleasure.\\nInarticulate as ever, Iinuma merely stood there crying. By his very silence he was trying\\nto tell Kiyoaki something. Their relationship had lasted some seven years, beginning in\\nthe spring when Kiyoaki was twelve. Since his recollection of his thoughts and feelings at\\nthat age were rather vague, he had the general impression that Iinuma had always been\\nthere beside him. If his boyhood and youth cast a shadow, that shadow was Iinuma, in\\nhis sweaty, dark blue, splashed-patterned kimono. The relentlessness of his discontent,\\nhis rancor, his negative attitude to life, had all weighed heavily on Kiyoaki, try as he\\nmight to feign immunity. On the other hand, however, the dark woe in Iinuma’s eyes had\\nserved to warn him against those very same attitudes in himself, although they were\\nnormal enough in youth. Iinuma’s particular demons had tormented him with manifest\\nviolence, and the more he wanted his young master to emulate him, the more Kiyoaki\\nhad shied off in the opposite direction, a predictable turn of events.\\nPsychologically, Kiyoaki had probably taken the first step toward today’s parting when\\nhe had broken the power that had dominated him for so long and turned Iinuma into his\\nconfidant. Their mutual understanding was probably too deep for master and retainer.\\nAs Iinuma stood before him with bowed head, the chest hair escaping from the neck of\\nhis blue kimono glistened faintly, caught in a ray of the evening sun. Kiyoaki stared\\ngloomily at this matted tangle, depressed at the realization of what a distastefully coarse\\nand heavy vessel Iinuma’s flesh made for his overpowering spirit of loyalty. It was, in\\nfact, a direct physical affront. Even the glow on Iinuma’s rough-skinned, pimpled cheeks,\\nmottled and unhealthy as it was, had something shameless about it that seemed to taunt\\nKiyoaki with Miné’s devotion—Miné who was leaving with Iinuma, ready to share his fate.\\nNothing could be more insulting: the young master betrayed by a woman and left to\\ngrieve; the retainer believing in a woman’s fidelity and going off triumphant. Iinuma,\\nmoreover, was quite secure in the conviction that today’s farewell had come about in the\\nline of duty—a presumption that Kiyoaki found galling.\\nHowever, deciding that noblesse oblige was the best course, he spoke humanely, if\\ncurtly.\\n“So then, once you’re on your own, I presume you’ll marry Miné?”\\n“Yes, sir. Since your father was gracious enough to suggest it, that’s exactly what I\\nshall do.”\\n“Well, let me know the date. I must send you a present.”\\n“Thank you very much, sir.”\\n“Once you have a permanent home, send me a note with your address.

He made it patently clear\\nthat in a situation such as this, the emptiest words were those that aroused the strongest\\nemotions. He professed to live for sentiment alone, but circumstances now compelled him\\nto learn the politics of the intellect. This was an education that he would apply to his own\\nlife with profit from time to time. He was learning to use sentiment as a protective armor\\nand how best to polish it.\\nDevoid of worry or annoyance, free of all anxiety, Kiyoaki at nineteen liked to see\\nhimself as a cold and supremely capable young man. He felt that he was now past some\\nwatershed in the course of his life.\\nAfter Iinuma had gone, he stood at the open window gazing down at the beautiful\\nreflection of the maple hill, with its fresh green mantle of new leaves, as it floated on the\\nwater of the pond. Close to the window itself, the foliage of the zelkova was so thick that\\nhe had to lean out in order to see the place at the bottom of the hill where the last of the\\nnine waterfalls plunged into its pool. All around the edge of the pond, the surface was\\ncovered with clusters of pale green water shields. The yellow water lilies had not yet\\nflowered, but in the angles of the stone bridge that zigzagged a path close to the main\\nreception room, irises were pushing their purple and white blossoms out from sharp-\\npointed clusters of green leaves.\\nHis eye was caught by the iridescent back of a beetle that had been standing on the\\nwindowsill but was now advancing steadily into his room. Two reddish purple stripes ran\\nthe length of its brilliant oval shell of green and gold. Now it waved its antennae\\ncautiously as it began to inch its way forward on its tiny hacksaw legs, which reminded\\nKiyoaki of minuscule jeweler’s blades. In the midst of time’s dissolving whirlpool, how\\nabsurd that this tiny dot of richly concentrated brilliance should endure in a secure world\\nof its own. As he watched, he gradually became fascinated. Little by little the beetle kept\\nedging its glittering body closer to him as if its pointless progress were a lesson that\\nwhen traversing a world of unceasing flux, the only thing of importance was to radiate\\nbeauty. Suppose he were to assess his protective armor of sentiment in such terms. Was\\nit aesthetically as naturally striking as that of this beetle? And was it tough enough to be\\nas good a shield as the beetle’s?\\nAt that moment, he almost persuaded himself that all its surroundings—leafy trees,\\nblue sky, clouds, tiled roofs—were there purely to serve this beetle which in itself was the\\nvery hub, the very nucleus of the universe.\\n∗\\nThe atmosphere of the Omiyasama festival was not the same as in previous years.

Fortunately, however, when the time\\ncame for the young priestesses in their scarlet \\nhakama\\n to distribute the sacred offerings\\nof wine to everyone, the sky lightened again. As the women bowed their heads, the\\nbright sunshine on the napes of their necks drew beads of sweat despite the heavy\\ncoating of white powder. At that moment, the clusters of wisteria blossoms on the trellis\\ncast deep shadows that fell like a benediction on those in the back rows.\\nHad Iinuma been present, the atmosphere of this year’s festival would doubtless have\\nangered him, since each year brought less reverence and mourning for Kiyoaki’s\\ngrandfather. He now seemed to have been relegated to a vanished era, especially since\\nthe death of the Meiji Emperor himself. And so he had become a distant god who had no\\nconnection at all with the modern world. True, his widow, Kiyoaki’s grandmother, took\\npart in the ceremony, as did a number of other old people; their tears, however, seemed\\nto have dried up long ago.\\nEach year as the painfully long ceremony went on, the women’s whispering grew\\nsteadily louder. The Marquis did not go out of his way to manifest disapproval. He himself\\nwas finding the observance more tedious year by year, and he was hopeful of finding\\nsome way of making it a bit more cheerful and less depressing for himself. During the\\nritual, his eye was drawn to a young priestess whose pronounced Okinawan features\\nwere all the more striking under her heavy white makeup. As she held the earthenware\\nvessel filled with sacred wine, he was fascinated by the reflection of her bold dark eyes\\non the surface of the liquid. As soon as the ceremony was over, he rushed over to his\\ncousin, who was not only an admiral but also a drinker of no small fame, and apparently\\nmade a vulgar joke about the priestess, for the admiral’s laugh was so loud and crude\\nthat it drew a number of stares. The Marquise, however, knowing how appropriate her\\nmask of classic melancholy was to today’s affair, did not alter her expression in the\\nslightest.\\nKiyoaki meanwhile was otherwise occupied. The women of the household, the whole\\nvast array of them, many of whom he did not even know by name, were crowded\\ntogether in the luxuriant shade of the late spring wisteria. They were whispering among\\nthemselves, their air of reverence vanishing with each passing moment.

In fact he rarely opened this scroll simply because he did not relish being confronted\\nwith the unhappy evidence of how much Satoko, two years older than he, had surpassed\\nhim even then. Now, however, as he studied the writing with a measure of objectivity, he\\nfelt that his own scrawl had a boyish vigor that made a pleasing contrast with the refined\\nelegance of Satoko’s smooth, flowing script.\\nBut there was more to it than that. The very thought of himself that day boldly setting\\ndown the tips of his writing brushes, heavy with ink, against the fine, gold-flecked paper\\nof the scroll, was enough to evoke the entire scene with the force of vivid immediacy. At\\nthat time, Satoko’s long, thick black hair was cut straight across at the brow. As she bent\\nover the scroll, she kept the handle of the writing brush tight in her slim, delicate fingers,\\nconcentrating with such passion that she was oblivious to the mass of hair that poured\\ndown her shoulders in a jet-black cascade, nearly flooding the scroll itself. Her small,\\nwhite teeth bit ruthlessly into her lower lip, and although she was just a little girl, her\\nnose was already well formed in her profile that stood out with sweet determination\\nagainst the torrent of falling hair. Kiyoaki watched as if in a dream. Then there was the\\nink that smelled dark and solemn, and the sound made by the tip of the brush as it raced\\nover the surface of the scroll, like the wind rustling through bamboo grass. And finally,\\nthere was the sea—the well of the inkstone was the sea, and above it rose the hill with\\nthe strange name. This sea fell away so sharply from its shore that it gave not so much\\nas a glimpse of its shallow bed. The still black sea, without a single wave, a sea spangled\\nwith gold powder fallen from the ink stick, always made him think of the rays of the moon\\nfragmented on the night sea of eternity.\\n“I can even enjoy memories of my past and it doesn’t bother me at all,” he thought in\\nsilent boast.\\nSatoko did not even appear in his dreams.

And then, even in\\nthe English classes, where their ability should have shown to advantage, the system of\\ntranslating from English into Japanese and from Japanese into English thoroughly\\nconfused them.\\nSince Marquis Matsugae had arranged to have Pattanadid’s ring placed in his personal\\nvault at the Itsu Bank, Kiyoaki had to return home to get his father’s seal before going to\\nthe bank to reclaim the ring. It was nearly evening before he returned to Peers and went\\nto the princes’ room.\\nIt was a typical “dry” day in the midst of the rainy season, overcast and humid, a day\\nthat was perfectly attuned to the frustration of the two princes, who were longing for the\\nsparkling summer weather that was still beyond reach, though it seemed close enough.\\nThe dormitory itself, a rough-frame one-story building surrounded by trees, seemed to be\\nsealed in a gloom all its own.\\nThe shouts coming from the direction of the athletics field indicated that rugby practice\\nwas still in full swing. Kiyoaki hated the idealistic cries that rose from those young\\nthroats. His classmates’ rough-and-ready relationships, their untried humanism, their\\nconstant jokes and puns, their never-faltering reverence for the talent of Rodin and the\\nperfection of Cézanne—they were no more than the modern equivalent of the old\\ntraditional shouts of \\nkendo.\\n And so, hoarse in voice and reeking of youth like green\\npaulownia leaves, they went about wearing their arrogance much as the ancient courtiers\\nwore their tall caps.\\nLife for the two princes was extremely difficult, having to swim in the midst of this\\nriptide of old and new. When Kiyoaki thought about this, he rose above his own\\npreoccupations and now was able, out of a new generosity, to sympathize with them. He\\nwalked down a dark, rough-finished corridor of the dormitory toward the princes’ room at\\nthe end of it, selected with such care.

That’s why we hide Ying\\nChan’s picture in here.”\\nChao P. was soon able to explain to Kiyoaki that no letter from Princess Ying Chan had\\ncome for more than two months. He had made inquiries about this at the Siamese\\nlegation but had not yet received a satisfactory answer. Moreover, the princess’s brother\\nPrince Kridsada himself had had no word about her. If something had happened to her, if\\nshe had fallen ill, he would normally have been informed by telegram. Chao P.’s\\nimagination was exacerbated by the thought of what her family might be hiding even\\nfrom her brother. It might well be that she was being pushed into another marriage, one\\nthat held greater political advantage. The very idea was enough to plunge him into\\ngloom. Tomorrow, he thought, there might be a letter, but even if there were, what\\nunhappiness might it not contain? With such thoughts preying on his mind, he was in no\\nstate to study.

And if being together brings joy, then it is\\nonly proper that separation should do the same in its own way.\\n“But what do you think, Matsugae? As for me, I’ve always wanted to know the secret\\nthat enables love to evade the bonds of time and space as if by magic. To stand before\\nthe person we love is not the same as loving her true self, for we are only apt to regard\\nher physical beauty as the indispensable mode of her existence. When time and space\\nintervene, it is possible to be deceived by both, but on the other hand, it is equally\\npossible to draw twice as close to her real self.”\\nKiyoaki had no idea how profound the prince’s philosophizing was intended to be, but\\nhe listened intently. Many of his words did, in fact, strike home. As for Satoko, Kiyoaki\\nbelieved that he had now indeed drawn that much closer to her real self. He saw quite\\nclearly that what he had loved had not been the real Satoko. But what proof did he have\\nof that? Wasn’t he liable to be deceived twice over? And wasn’t the Satoko he loved once\\nagain the real Satoko after all? He shook his head slightly, almost unconsciously.

He knew that if\\nhe threw it into the wastebasket in his own room, he would be tempted to take it out and\\nreassemble the fragments. Yamada’s eyes flickered with surprise behind his glasses, but\\nhe said not a word.\\nA few more days passed. The matter of the torn-up letter began to weigh on Kiyoaki\\nand his reaction took the form of anger. This was more than mere irritation that a\\nsupposedly trivial letter should have such power to unsettle him. What was agonizing was\\nthe realization, impossible to ignore, that he now regretted the decision not to open it. At\\nfirst he had been able to regard the letter’s destruction as proof of his strength of will, but\\nin retrospect he was now beset by the feeling that on the contrary he had acted out of\\nsheer cowardice.\\nWhen he had torn up that thick, plain white envelope, his fingers had encountered stiff\\nresistance, as though the letter had perhaps been written on paper reinforced with tough\\nlinen fiber. But it was not the paper’s composition that mattered. He now realized that\\nhad it not been for his burst of willpower, it would have been impossible for him to tear it\\nup. Why should he have been afraid? He had no desire to become painfully involved with\\nSatoko again. He hated the very thought of being re-enveloped in that fragrant haze of\\nanxiety that she could conjure at will, especially now that he had finally achieved\\ncommand over himself again.

Finally he could wait no longer, and took off his school uniform,\\ndressing in a Satsuma splashed-pattern kimono and \\nhakama.\\n Then he called one of the\\nservants and told him to have a rickshaw waiting for him.\\nFollowing his plan, he left the rickshaw at Aoyama, 6-chome, which was the terminus\\nfor the streetcar that went to Roppongi. He boarded it and rode to the end of the line.\\nAround the corner from Roppongi, at the turn to Toriizaka, were three huge zelkova trees,\\nthe remainder of the six that had given the Roppongi or Six Trees district its name.\\nBeneath them, just as in old times before there were streetcars in Tokyo, a big placard\\nwith “Rickshaw Stand” scrawled on it was fastened to a post, and rickshaw men in conical\\nwicker hats, short jackets, and blue trousers were gathered waiting for customers.\\nKiyoaki called one of them, immediately handed him an exorbitant tip and told him to\\ntake him at once to the Ayakura mansion, which was no more than a few minutes away\\non foot. The old-fashioned Ayakura gate would not admit the Matsugaes’ English carriage,\\nand so if it were still waiting outside with the gate open, he would know that his mother\\nwas still there. However, if it were gone and the gate closed, he could safely assume that\\nshe had already fulfilled her ceremonial obligations and left.\\nWhen the rickshaw passed the gate, he saw that it was shut and in the road in front he\\nrecognized the marks left by a carriage.\\nHe instructed the rickshaw man to take him back to the top of Toriizaka. Once there he\\nsent him back on foot for Tadeshina while he himself remained behind, making use of the\\ncover provided by the rickshaw.\\nAs it turned out, he had a long wait. Through an opening in the side of the rickshaw, he\\nwatched the setting rays of summer sun flood the new leaves clustered at the tips of the\\nbranches. It seemed to be slowly submerging them in liquid brilliance. A giant horse\\nchestnut towered above the red brick wall that ran along the edge of the slope of\\nToriizaka. Its very topmost leaves made him think of a white bird’s nest decorated with a\\nloosely woven crown of white flowers tipped with pink. Then all at once he was thinking\\nof that snowy morning in February, and for no obvious reason he was shaken by a violent\\nwave of excitement. But nevertheless, his intention was not to force an immediate\\nmeeting with Satoko, for since passion had now found a definite course, he was no longer\\nvulnerable to each new onrush of emotion.\\nTadeshina came out of a side entrance, followed by the rickshaw man.

The Marquise your mother took her leave just a\\nfew minutes ago. Then tonight we’re preparing for an informal celebration . . . I’m really\\nso busy.”\\n“Never mind. Hurry up and tell the boy where to go.”\\nSince Kiyoaki kept a firm grip on her hand, she had no choice but to comply.\\n“Go toward Kasumicho,” she told the rickshaw man. “Near Number Three there’s a road\\ngoing downhill that turns toward the main gate of the Third Regiment barracks. Please\\ntake us just to the bottom of the slope.”\\nThe rickshaw lurched forward and Tadeshina stared straight ahead with desperate\\nconcentration, nervously smoothing back a stray hair. This was the first time he had been\\nso close to this old woman with her thick mask of white powder, and the experience was\\nfar from pleasant. Yet he could not help but notice that she was even tinier than he had\\nimagined, hardly more than a dwarf in fact. Buffeted by the shaking rickshaw, she kept up\\na mumbled stream of protest that he could only barely understand.\\n“It’s too late, too late . . . no matter what, it’s just too late.” And then: “If only you’d\\nsent one word of answer . . . before this happened. Oh why . . . ?”\\nKiyoaki said nothing and so she finally said something about their destination just\\nbefore they got there: “A distant relative of mine runs an inn for soldiers near here. It’s\\nnot a very presentable place but an annex is always available, and it will permit me to\\nhear whatever the young master wishes to say in confidence.”\\nTomorrow was Sunday, when Roppongi would be transformed suddenly into a bustling\\ngarrison district, its streets full of khaki-uniformed soldiers, many out strolling with their\\nvisiting families. But it was still Saturday afternoon, and this transformation was yet to\\ntake place. As the rickshaw carried him along through the streets toward Tadeshina’s\\ndestination, he had the feeling that on that snowy morning too, he and Satoko had\\npassed first this spot, then another. Just as he became convinced that he remembered\\nthe slope they were following, Tadeshina told the man to stop.\\nThey were in front of an inn at the foot of the slope. Its main wing was two stories\\nhigh, and although it had neither gate nor entranceway, it was surrounded by a good-\\nsized garden enclosed by a broad fence.\\nStanding outside this fence, Tadeshina glanced up at the second floor of the rough\\nwooden structure. It showed no sign of life. The six glass doors facing the front were\\nshut, and none of the interior was visible. The low-quality panes in the latticed doors\\nmirrored the evening sky in their own warped fashion, even catching the reflection of a\\ncarpenter working on an adjacent roof and distorting his image as though it were lying\\nacross water. The sky itself bore a watery image as seen there, tinged with the\\nmelancholy of a lake at evening time.\\n“It would of course be awkward if the soldiers were back—but only officers take rooms\\nhere,” Tadeshina said as she pushed open a close-worked lattice door beside which there\\nhung a plaque of the Goddess of Children.

A small scroll suitable for a tea ceremony room hung in\\na little alcove, and there was even a sliding Genji screen. The atmosphere was quite\\ndifferent from what one would have expected from the exterior, that of a cheap inn\\nfrequented by the army.\\n“What then do you so kindly wish to communicate to me?” Tadeshina asked as soon as\\nthe innkeeper withdrew. When Kiyoaki did not answer, she repeated her question,\\nmaking no further effort to hide her irritation.\\n“What is this all about? And why choose today of all days . . . ?”\\n“Because it’s so appropriate. I want you to arrange a meeting between me and\\nSatoko.”\\n“What do you mean, young master? It’s too late. After what’s happened, how can you\\nask such a thing? From now on, there’s nothing more to be done. Everything must be\\nsubordinated to the Emperor’s pleasure.

Angrily he accused her of having allowed Satoko to\\nread his letter and then to lie about it brazenly, and also of having spread malicious\\ngossip that had lost him his faithful retainer Iinuma. Tadeshina finally contrived to burst\\ninto tears, and apologized abjectly on her knees.\\nShe then pulled some tissue paper from the sleeve of her kimono and began to wipe\\nher eyes, rubbing away the white powder around them to reveal the pink web of wrinkles\\nover her cheekbones, unmistakable proof of mortality. There was hardly any difference in\\ntexture between that wrinkled skin and the crumpled, rouge-smeared piece of tissue.\\nFinally, staring into thin air, she began to talk.\\n“It’s true.

He looked around the room and noticed that a bamboo blind\\nwas now covering the window through which he had looked up at the second floor of the\\nmain wing last time.

At this moment she held an irresistible attraction for him, in her kimono the\\ncolor of white wisteria, but it was not merely that of a rich prize finally within his grasp; it\\nwas the lure of the forbidden, the utterly unattainable, the proscribed. He wanted her this\\nway and no other. And she herself, on the other hand, had always wanted to keep him off\\nbalance by playing games. How things had changed now!

Their fingers lay tangled for a few moments in its folds, and then as its clip\\nsuddenly fell away, the obi uncoiled in a rustle of silk and sprang away from her body as\\nthough it had a life of its own. It was the beginning of a confused riot of uncontrollable\\nmovements. Her entire kimono swirled in revolt as he tore frantically at the folds of silk\\nthat bound her breasts, rebuffed at every turn by a whole network of straps that\\ntightened as others came loose. But then right before his eyes, he saw the tiny, well-\\nguarded triangle of white below her throat spread into a rich and fragrant expanse of\\nskin.\\nShe did not actually utter a word of protest.

Considering the gravity of the confession and the limitless trust\\nit implied, Kiyoaki could hardly have given him greater cause for happiness. As he studied\\nhis friend, he found Kiyoaki noticeably matured, and some of the beauty that had\\nbelonged to the face of an irresolute young boy was gone from his features.

It had been raining since morning.\\nHonda’s father was a justice of the Supreme Court and, even within his own family,\\nwas a strict observer of principles. He was greatly pleased by the promise shown by his\\nnineteen-year-old son, who had applied himself to the law even before entering college.\\nHis father thus felt confident enough to conclude that his son would eventually succeed\\nhim. Up to this year, the office of judge had been for life, but the previous April a large-\\nscale reform of the juridical system had been put into effect. As a result, more than two\\nhundred judges had been laid off or requested to hand in their resignations. Justice\\nHonda, wanting to show his solidarity with his unfortunate old friends, had offered his\\nown resignation, but it had not been accepted.\\nThe experience, however, seemed to have marked a turning point in his views on life,\\nwhich, in their turn, affected what had been a rather formal relationship with his son.\\nFrom then on, he brought to it a warmth of generosity that resembled the affection\\nshown by a high official to the subordinate he has selected to succeed him. Honda\\nhimself was determined to work harder than ever at his studies to try to be worthy of\\nsuch unprecedented favor.\\nOne result of his father’s changed views was that he permitted his son to attend court\\nsessions even though he was not yet an adult. He did not, of course, go so far as to let\\nhim come into his own court, but he gave him permission to watch whatever civil or\\ncriminal cases he liked, as long as he was accompanied by the young retainer who was\\nalso a law student.\\nHis father explained to Shigekuni that since all his familiarity with the law came from\\nbooks, it would be extremely valuable for him to come in contact with the actual process\\nof law in Japan and to experience it at a practical level.

Ever\\nsince Kiyoaki had confided in him, Shigekuni, who would have been bright and confident,\\nas befitted such an able young man, had undergone a change. Or rather, the friendship\\nbetween him and Kiyoaki had undergone a strange reversal. For years, each of them had\\nbeen extremely careful to intrude in no way on the personal life of the other. But now,\\njust three days before, Kiyoaki had suddenly come to him and, like a newly cured patient\\ntransmitting his disease to someone else, had passed on to his friend the virus of\\nintrospection. It had taken hold so readily that Honda’s disposition now seemed a far\\nbetter host to it than Kiyoaki’s. The first major symptom of the disease was a vague\\nsense of apprehension.\\nWhat was Kiyoaki to do, he wondered. Was it right for himself, as Kiyoaki’s friend, to do\\nnothing more than sit by idly and let things take their course?\\nWhile he waited for the court session to begin at one thirty, he sat engrossed in the\\nreflections provoked by his anxiety, his mind far from the hearings that he had come to\\nattend.\\n“If I were really to act as a true friend,” he thought, “wouldn’t it be best to persuade\\nhim to try and forget Miss Satoko?

He wanted to leave at once, rush to Kiyoaki’s house and pour out\\nevery argument at his command to persuade him to change his mind. And the frustration\\nof realizing that this was impossible caused a new upsurge of anxiety that increased his\\ndiscomfiture.\\nHe glanced around and noticed that all the seats had been filled.

It was an instructive sight, and one that, more than\\nanything seen previously, opened his eyes to the moral ugliness of the belief that “Oh,\\nI’m in no danger of ever committing a sin.” Whatever the future might hold, he was\\ndetermined never to fall prey to that kind of attitude.\\nThe windows were shut against the rain, and they admitted a dull, flat light that lay\\nover all the spectators indifferently like a coat of gray dust; only the shiny black visors of\\nthe guards’ caps were exempt from it.\\nThe entrance of the defendant set up a flurry of comment.

Then after she had entered the dock, all he could see was that her\\nhair was pulled back in the cylindrical bun worn by female prisoners. Although she\\nhunched forward respectfully, he noticed that there was a little sign of nervous strain in\\nthe way her plump shoulders were set beneath her uniform.\\nThe defense lawyer had already come in, and now everyone was waiting for the public\\nprosecutor and the judge himself.\\n“Just take a look at her, young master.

The knife sharpener had a great deal of\\nother work to do, but she would not be turned away. After she had waited for over an\\nhour, he finally sharpened it for her. When she left his shop, she had not felt at all like\\ngoing back home, and finally had turned almost involuntarily in the direction of the\\nKishimoto Inn.\\nShortly beforehand, Hidé had returned to the Kishimoto after enjoying a wild night with\\nMatsukichi and had been lectured by the innkeeper’s wife for leaving work. She had gone\\nto the woman and apologized tearfully, just as Matsukichi had instructed. It was only a\\nfew minutes after this was over that Tomi arrived at the inn and asked to speak to Hidé\\nfor a moment outside. Hidé came out to see her and was surprisingly cordial. She had\\njust changed into a stylish working kimono, and as she walked along the street with\\nTomi, her loose clogs scraped languidly along the ground in the manner affected by\\naffluent prostitutes.\\n“I made a promise to the boss just now. From now on I’m going to have nothing more\\nto do with men, I told her,” she said.\\nTomi felt a rush of happiness when she heard this, but next moment Hidé, smiling\\nbrightly, robbed her words of all significance with a further remark: “But I don’t know if I\\ncan hold out even for three days.”\\nMaking a great effort at self-control, Tomi then offered to treat her to a drink at a\\nnearby \\nsushi\\n shop on the bank of the Sumida River. Once they had begun to drink, Tomi\\ndid her best to talk to her as though she were addressing her elder sister, but Hidé\\nrefused to be drawn; her only reaction was an ironic smile. And finally, when she was\\nprobably driven to melodramatic extremes by the saké, Tomi lowered her head in\\nsupplication, but the younger woman turned away in brusque contempt. They had been\\nthere for over an hour by this time, and it was dark outside. Hidé got up to go, saying\\nthat the manager would be angry at her again unless she returned immediately.\\nAfter they left the \\nsushi\\n shop, Tomi claimed that she did not know why they wandered\\ninto a badly lit vacant lot in Hama that lay by the river. She said that perhaps when she\\ntugged at Hidé’s kimono, trying to get her to stay and talk, Hidé had happened to begin\\nwalking in this direction as she pulled herself free. At any rate, Tomi denied any intention\\nof having led her that way in order to kill her.\\nAfter walking for a short time, Tomi began to argue again, but Hidé only laughed. As\\nshe did so, her even teeth flashed white, although there was no more than a glint of light\\non the surface of the Sumida to relieve the darkness that engulfed the two of them.\\n“It’s no use you keeping on like this,” Hidé replied at last. “No wonder Matsukichi got so\\nfed up with you.”\\nThis, according to Tomi, was the decisive moment, as she went on to describe her\\nreactions.\\n“When I heard that, the blood rushed to my head.

She alone was endowed with the privilege of emotion. Until a few moments\\nbefore, the spectators had seen nothing but a plump, perspiring thirty-one-year-old\\nwoman.

For it was the vivid character of the crime itself, rather than any consideration of\\ngood intentions or moral scruples, that she had impressed with such cogent force upon\\nthe spectators. Tomi Masuda’s self-revelation far surpassed the possible accomplishment\\nof even the most skilled of actresses, who, after all, would have revealed no more than\\nshe had intended. It amounted to facing the whole world and turning it into one giant\\naudience. Her lawyer, who stood beside her, seemed too shabby to have any capacity to\\nhelp. She stood there, a short, plump figure, with nothing to mitigate her drabness—no\\ncombs in her hair, no jewelry, no fine kimono to catch a man’s eye—but the fact of being\\na criminal was enough to make them see her as a woman.\\n“If we had the jury system here in Japan, this is the kind of case where they might let\\nher get away with it,” said the law student, whispering in Shigekuni’s ear again. “What\\ncan you do with a glib woman like that?”\\nShigekuni sat thinking.

Prince Pattanadid lost his emerald ring. The affair\\nbecame very serious when it became generally known that Prince Kridsada had protested\\nin anger that the ring had been stolen. More than anything else, Prince Pattanadid\\nwanted the matter to be settled as quietly as possible, and he rebuked his cousin for his\\nrudeness. Nevertheless, it was evident that in his heart, he, too, believed it to have been\\nstolen.\\nPrince Kridsada’s angry charge provoked a predictable response from the school\\nadministration. They said that such a thing as theft was unthinkable at Peers. The\\nensuing turmoil was eventually to reach such proportions that the princes, more and\\nmore homesick, were finally to decide that they wanted to return to Siam. The chain of\\nevents that was to put them on a collision course with the school began when the\\ndormitory prefect, trying to be as helpful as possible, asked them to give him an account\\nof the events immediately preceding the disappearance of the ring.\\nAs he continued to question them, their stories began to differ. They both agreed that\\nthey had gone for a walk on campus in the early evening, returned to the dormitory for\\ndinner, and then discovered the loss of the ring when they went back to their room\\nafterwards. Prince Kridsada claimed that his cousin had worn the ring during the walk and\\nthen left it in the room before dinner, contending, therefore, that it must have been\\nstolen during dinner. But Prince Pattandid himself was not so sure on this point, as was\\nevident from the vagueness of his testimony. He was sure that had worn the ring when\\nhe went out for the walk but confessed that he could not remember whether or not he\\nhad left it in his room during the meal.\\nThis, of course, was crucial to deciding whether the ring had been stolen or lost. Then,\\nwhen the prefect asked about where they had been on their walk, he discovered that the\\ntwo princes, drawn by the pleasant evening, had gone through the fence surrounding the\\nReviewing Mound and had lain down for a while on the grass at the top, an act forbidden\\nby school rules. It was not until the next day, a muggy afternoon with intermittent\\nshowers, that the prefect heard their account of what had happened. Nevertheless, he\\ndecided that there was only one thing to be done, and he asked the princes to come with\\nhim at once so that all three of them could make a thorough search of the top of the\\nmound.\\nThe Reviewing Mound was in a corner of the drill field.

It was considered the most venerable place at Peers, second only to the\\nsanctuary where Emperor Meiji had planted a sakaki.\\nAccompanied by the prefect, the two princes passed through the fence again, this time\\nin broad daylight, and climbed to the top of the mound. The grass had been soaked by\\nthe drizzle, and the task they faced of searching roughly two hundred square yards of the\\nmound’s surface was obviously not going to be an easy one. Since it did not seem\\nadequate to search merely the spot where they had lain down, the prefect decided that\\nthey should divide the area into three, with each of them scouring a section. And so with\\nthe rain, now increasing somewhat, falling on their backs, they picked through the grass,\\nblade by blade.\\nPrince Kridsada made little effort to hide his reluctance, and carried out his task with a\\ncertain amount of grumbling. Prince Pattanadid, however, being good-natured, began his\\nsearch more willingly, recognizing that it did, after all, concern his own ring. He started at\\nthe bottom of the slope in his section and worked his way upwards with great precision.\\nHe had never taken so close a look at each blade of grass. For nothing less than the\\nmost painstaking care would do, because despite the ring’s gold setting, its large emerald\\nwould be next to invisible in the grass. The drizzle became raindrops on the back of his\\nneck, finally slid under his tight collar and rolled down his back, a sensation that aroused\\na yearning for the warm monsoons of Siam. The light green at the roots of the grass gave\\nthe illusion that a ray of sunshine had broken through, but the sky remained overcast.\\nHere and there, there were small white wildflowers in the grass, their heads drooping\\nunder the weight of the rain, but the powdery whiteness of their petals remained as\\nbright as ever. Once Prince Pattanadid’s eye was caught by a bright glittering spot under\\na sawtooth leaf of a tall weed. Sure that his ring could not have lodged there, he\\nnevertheless turned the leaf over to find a small, brilliantly colored beetle clinging to the\\nunderside to escape the rain.\\nPeering at the grass at such close range made it loom up under his nose, immense and\\ngreen, reminding him of the jungles of his homeland in the rainy season. With his eyes\\nthus fixed on the grass, he could imagine the gathering cumulus clouds shining with such\\nwhite intensity, the sky a deep azure blue in one quarter but dark and threatening in\\nanother, and he could even hear the violent rumble of thunder.\\nIt was not really the ring that made him willing to expend such painful effort. He wore\\nhimself out searching through the grass that defied his exertions for the sake of\\nrecovering the image of Princess Chan, however slight the hope of success.

The\\ngarden, however, which spread out from the terrace on the south side of the house, had\\nbeen landscaped entirely in the Western style. From this same terrace, one could see the\\nisland of Oshima, its volcano glowing at night like a distant bonfire.

In fact\\nthe Marquis, with the aid of binoculars, could sit on the terrace and watch the Marquise\\nfrolicking in the surf, an incidental diversion that amused him greatly. There was a narrow\\nfield of vegetables between the garden and the beach, however, and in order to suppress\\nthis element of discord, a line of pines had been planted along the southern edge of the\\ngarden. Once these trees were fully grown, they would destroy the uninterrupted view\\nfrom the garden to the sea, and the Marquis would no longer be able to amuse himself\\nwith his binoculars.\\nOn clear summer days, the beauty of the villa’s setting was at its peak.

While the areas that lay in\\nshadow resisted the probing sun, its bright rays threw the rugged force of their sculptured\\noutlines into relief.

Its might first overshadowed the\\nbeach and the vegetable field, and then, moving up toward the house, it overran the\\nsouthern border of the garden.

As he watched the final surge of each wave\\nas it drained into the sand, the final thrust of mighty power that had come down through\\ncountless centuries, he was struck by the pathos of it all. At that very point, a grand pan-\\noceanic enterprise that spanned the world went awry and ended in annihilation.\\nBut still, he thought, this final frustration was a gentle, soothing one. A small, lacy frill,\\nthe wave’s last farewell, escaped from disintegration at the last moment before merging\\ninto the glistening wet sand as the wave itself withdrew, and vanished into the sea.\\nStarting a good way out in the offing at a point where the whitecaps thinned out, the\\nincoming waves went through four or five stages, each of which was visible at any given\\nmoment—a swelling, a cresting, a breaking, the dissolution of its force and an ebbing—a\\nconstantly recurring process.\\nThe breaking wave let out an angry roar as it showed its smooth, dark green belly.

Despite\\nhimself, Honda’s eyes fell on the moles on Kiyoaki’s side again. This time he thought that\\nthey looked like some grains of sand that had embedded themselves in his white skin.\\nThe dry area of the beach ended right at their feet, and here and there the waves had\\nsplashed up beyond their usual limit and left contracted patterns of wet sand behind\\nthem, a sort of bas-relief that preserved the trace of the wave.

Tangles of brown algae,\\nfragments of wood, pieces of straw, and even orange peelings had been cast up and lay\\nfixed in the sand.

But if it’s a case of a man’s personality coming to\\nan end and his self-awareness being lost so that there’s absolutely no trace of them in his\\nnext life, and if a completely new personality and a totally different self-awareness come\\ninto being, well, in that case I think that various reincarnations extending over a period of\\ntime are no more significantly linked to one another than the lives of all the individuals\\nwho happen to be alive at the same given moment. In other words, I feel that in such a\\ncase the concept of reincarnation would be practically meaningless. Something has to be\\npassed on in transmigration, but I don’t see how we can take any number of separate\\nand distinct existences, each with its own self-awareness, and bracket them together as\\none, claiming that a single consciousness unites them. Right now, each one of us has no\\nmemory at all of even a single previous existence. And so it’s obvious that it would be\\npointless to try to produce any proof of transmigration. There’s only one way that it could\\nbe proved: if we had a self-awareness so independent that it could stand aside from both\\nthis life and previous lives and view them objectively. But as it is, each man’s\\nconsciousness is limited to the past, the present, or the future of that single life. In the\\nmidst of the turmoil of history, each one of us builds his own little shelter of self-\\nawareness and we can never leave it. Buddhism seems to hold out a middle way, but I\\nhave my doubts: is this middle way an organic concept which a human being is capable of\\ngrasping?\\n“But to go back just a bit. . . . Granted that all human concepts are mere illusion, in\\norder to distinguish the various illusions arising from other reincarnations from the illusion\\nof the present reincarnation of that same life, you must nevertheless be able to observe\\nthem all from a thoroughly independent viewpoint. It’s only when one stands aside in this\\nway that the reality of reincarnation would be apparent. But when one is in the midst of a\\nreincarnated existence oneself, the whole must remain an eternal riddle. Moreover, since\\nthis independent standpoint is probably what is called full enlightenment, only the man\\nwho has transcended reincarnation can grasp its reality. And wouldn’t it then be a case of\\nfinally understanding it at a time when it was no longer relevant?\\n“There is an abundance of death in our lives. We never lack reminders—funerals,\\ncemeteries, withered commemorative bouquets, memories of the dead, deaths of friends,\\nand then the anticipation of our own death. Who knows? Perhaps in their own way the\\ndead make a great deal of life. Perhaps they’re always looking in our direction from their\\nown land—at our towns, our schools, the smokestacks of our factories, at each of us who\\nhas passed one by one back from death into the land of the living.\\n“What I want to say is that perhaps reincarnation is nothing more than a concept that\\nreverses the way that we, the living, ordinarily view death, a concept that expresses life\\nas seen from the viewpoint of the dead.

Why then do you object so strongly to differing senses\\nof self-awareness inhabiting the same body over a similar period of time?”\\n“The same body for a cat and a human being? According to what you said before, it\\nwas a matter of becoming a man, a swan, a quail, a deer, and so on.”\\n“Yes, according to the concept of reincarnation, the same body.

However, rather than do that, perhaps it would be better to call it the\\nsame vital current.\\n“I lost that emerald ring that was so rich in memories for me. It wasn’t a living thing, of\\ncourse, and so it won’t be reborn. But still, the loss of something is significant, and I think\\nthat loss is the necessary source of a new manifestation. Some night I might see my\\nemerald ring appear as a green star somewhere in the sky.”\\nThe prince abruptly abandoned the problem, apparently overcome with sadness.\\n“Chao P., maybe the ring was actually a living thing that underwent a secret\\ntransformation,” Kridsada responded with earnest naïveté, “and then it ran off\\nsomewhere on legs of its own.”\\n“Then, round about now it might be reborn as someone as beautiful as Princess Chan,”\\nChao P. said, now completely absorbed in thinking about his loved one. “People keep\\ntelling me in their letters that she’s well, but why don’t I hear anything at all from her\\nherself? Perhaps they’re all trying to protect me from something.”\\nHonda, meantime, had ignored the prince’s last words, as he was lost in thought about\\nthe strange paradox that Chao P. had brought up a few minutes earlier. One could\\ncertainly think of a man not in terms of a body but as a single vital current. And this\\nwould allow one to grasp the concept of existence as dynamic and on-going, rather than\\nas static. Just as he had said, there was no difference between a single consciousness\\npossessing various vital currents in succession, and a single vital current animating\\nvarious consciousnesses in succession. For life and self-awareness would fuse into a\\nwhole. And if one were then to extrapolate this theory of the unity of life and self-\\nawareness, the whole sea of life with its infinity of currents—the whole vast process of\\ntransmigration called \\nSamsara\\n in Sanskrit—would be possessed by a single\\nconsciousness.\\nWhile Honda organized his ideas, the beach had gradually been growing darker, and\\nKiyoaki became absorbed in building a sand temple with Kridsada.

Honda was amused at the spectacle, but his\\namusement was tinged with disgust. He wondered if Kiyoaki had used him in much the\\nsame way as he was using Itsui.\\n“Well, you are turning out to be altogether different from what I imagined. I never\\nthought I’d see this side of you. But you’re still being secretive.

And in return, when the exams come round, you’ll remember old Itsui,\\nwon’t you?” he said, bowing his head in mock supplication that was still meant in earnest.\\nThe light of friendship shone in his eyes. Despite Honda’s awesome brain, Itsui now felt\\non a par with him in many respects.

Kiyo should think himself the\\nluckiest man in the world to have a friend like you. You see, we women have no real\\nfriends at all.”\\nSatoko’s eyes still burned with passion, but her coiffure was in perfect order, with not a\\nhair out of place.

What else am I but a slut?”\\n“Don’t talk like that,” he replied with considerable force.

She hardly ever wore Western clothes, and now hated the glaring white of\\nher dress. Forgetting the whiteness of her skin, she had only one thought: to tear the\\ndress off as quickly as possible and hide herself in the darkness.\\nNo one was likely to see them, but the rays of moonlight, infinitely fragmented over the\\nsurface of the sea, were like millions of eyes. She gazed up at the clouds suspended in\\nthe sky and the stars that seemed to graze their edges. She could feel Kiyoaki’s small,\\nfirm nipples touching hers, brushing against them playfully, then finally pressing against\\nthem, pushing down into the rich abundance of her breasts. It was a touch far more\\nintimate than a kiss, something like the playful caress of a young animal. An intense\\nsweetness hovered on the edge of her awareness. The unexpected familiarity when the\\nvery edges, the extremities of their bodies brushed together made her think of the stars\\nsparkling among the clouds, even though her eyes were closed.\\nFrom there it was a direct path to a joy as profound as the sea. But even as she felt\\nherself dissolving gradually into the darkness, she felt afraid that this was nothing more\\nthan a shadow that was dependent in turn on the fishing boat beside them. They were\\nnot lying in the protection of a solid structure or a rocky ridge, but of something\\nfortuitous, that in a few brief hours might be far out to sea. Had the boat not happened\\nto be beached there at that moment, its heavy shadow would have been no more real\\nthan a ghost. She was afraid that this huge old fishing boat might begin to slide\\nnoiselessly across the sand even now and plunge into the water and sail away.

The princes had been\\nquick enough in picking up “twist,” the slang word for cigarettes at Peers. The school\\nrules forbade smoking, but the authorities allowed the upperclassmen a certain amount\\nof laxity, provided they did not go so far as to smoke openly. The boiler room in the\\nbasement had thus become a haven for smokers and was known as “the Twist Room.”\\nEven now, as the four of them puffed on their cigarettes beneath the open sky without\\nfear of being observed, they sensed the lingering, secret pleasure that went with smoking\\nin the Twist Room. The smell of coal dust that filled the boiler room, eyes flashing white\\nin the gloom as their classmates kept careful watch, the deep, luxurious puffs of smoke,\\nthe recurring restless glow of the red tips—these and many other impressions now\\nenriched the fine flavor of their English cigarettes.\\nKiyoaki turned away from the others, and as he watched the smoke trailing away into\\nthe sky, he saw how the cloud formations out over the ocean were beginning to dissolve,\\ntheir clear outlines now blurred and tinged with a pale gold. At once he thought of\\nSatoko. Her image, her scent, were mingled with so many things. There was no alteration\\nof nature, however slight, that did not bring her to mind. If the breeze suddenly dropped\\nand the warm atmosphere of the summer evening pressed in on him, he felt Satoko brush\\nnaked against his own nakedness. Even the gradually deepening shadow cast on the lawn\\nby the dense green foliage of the silk tree held a hint of her.\\nAs for Honda, he could never be quite at ease unless there were books within easy\\nreach. Among those now at hand was a book he had been lent in secret by one of the\\nstudent houseboys, a book proscribed by the government. Entitled \\nNationalism and\\nAuthentic Socialism\\n, it had been written by a young man named Terujiro Kita, who at\\ntwenty-three was looked upon as the Japanese Otto Weininger. However, it was rather\\ntoo colorful in its presentation of an extremist position, and this aroused caution in\\nHonda’s calm and reasonable mind. It was not that he had any particular dislike of radical\\npolitical thought. But never having been really angry himself, he tended to view violent\\nanger in others as some terrible, infectious disease.

On the day of the cherry blossom\\ngarden party, the proprietress had been in charge behind the scenes and the old geisha\\nhad played the part of the haiku master. When they had come for the first mahjong\\nsession, the proprietress had delivered a speech of congratulation to the Count and\\nCountess on the engagement and had also brought an extravagant present:\\n“What a beautiful lady your daughter is! And as she is possessed of the gracious dignity\\nof a born princess, how pleased you must be at this betrothal. The memory of your\\npermitting us to be associated with it will remain with us forever, and we will pass it on\\nfrom generation to generation—in the utmost secrecy of course.”\\nAfter this commendable expression of their esteem, however, the proprietress and her\\ncompanion had not been quite up to maintaining the proper veneer when they retired to\\nanother room and sat down at the mahjong table with Tadeshina and Satoko. The eyes\\nso overflowing with damp devotion to Satoko would, from time to time, run dry, exposing\\nthe shoals of criticism beneath. Tadeshina was distastefully conscious of the same look\\nturned upon her and her old-fashioned silver obi clip.

She might have done this merely to chide her companion for introducing an\\nunsuitable topic, but the exchange had set Tadeshina’s nerves on edge.\\nIn accordance with her advice, Satoko tried to say as little as possible.

Then, in order to give her makeup a final inspection, she would pick up a pair of\\nold-fashioned spectacles, which she ordinarily avoided wearing, and put them on, hooking\\nthe slender metal side pieces over her ears.

Her mother was to have gone with her, but since she was in bed with a slight\\ncold, Tadeshina would accompany her alone. They were to meet at the store, but not\\nunder the eyes of the salesclerks, which wouldn’t do. So Kiyoaki was to be waiting at the\\nentrance decorated with the lion’s statue at three o’clock. When Satoko and Tadeshina\\ncame out, he was to pretend to ignore them, but follow them at a distance. Finally, when\\nthey had entered a small bean-soup restaurant nearby, where they were unlikely to be\\nseen, he could follow and speak to her for a short time. In the meantime, their rickshaw\\nman, waiting at the front entrance of Mitsukoshi’s, would think they were still inside.\\nHe left school early, and at three o’clock he was waiting in the crowd of shoppers at the\\nentrance of Mitsukoshi’s, wearing a raincoat over his uniform so that it concealed even his\\ncollar insignia.

Her head was drooping\\nand her eyes were now filled with tears. Tadeshina, fearful that the other customers\\nwould notice, took out a white handkerchief and shook Satoko by the shoulder. Her\\ngesture struck Kiyoaki as harsh, and he glared at her angrily.\\n“Why are you looking at me like that?” she retorted, her words full of rudeness. “Don’t\\nyou realize, young master, that I’ve been driving myself frantic for you and Miss Satoko?\\nAnd not just you, young master—Miss Satoko, you don’t understand what I’ve been\\nthrough either.

Since the\\nsecond period was almost upon them, they now turned and retraced their steps. A vast\\nvariety of objects had come to rest on the path underfoot as it wound its way through the\\nautumn woods—tangled heaps of wet, brown leaves, their skeletons conspicuous, acorns,\\ngreen chestnuts, split open and rotting, cigarette butts. Then in the midst of all this,\\nHonda saw something that made him stop and stare at the ground. It was a whitish,\\ncrumpled lump of fur, sickly white. By the time he had recognized it as the body of a\\nyoung mole, Kiyoaki had also stopped and squatted down to study it in silence as it lay in\\nthe sunlight filtering down through the branches overhead. The dead animal was lying on\\nits back, and the whiteness that had caught Honda’s attention was the fur of its belly.\\nThe rest of its body was a sleek, velvet black. Mud was worked into the lines of its tiny,\\nintricately formed white paws, proof of strenuous digging. As it was lying on its back, they\\ncould see its pointed beaklike mouth. Its death rictus revealed the soft, pink interior of its\\nmouth behind the two delicate incisors.\\nAt the same moment the two young men thought of the black dog whose dead body\\nhad hung over the edge of the waterfall on the Matsugae estate until sent on its way with\\naltogether unexpected funereal solemnity.\\nKiyoaki picked the young mole up by its almost hairless tail and laid it gently in his\\npalm. It was already rather shriveled, and so there was nothing distasteful about it. What\\nwas disturbing, however, was that this wretched little animal was condemned to labor\\nblindly and without purpose. The very care and delicacy that had gone into the shaping of\\nits tiny paws were odious.\\nKiyoaki took the animal by the tail again as he stood up. At this point the path passed\\nclose to the pond, and he casually turned and threw the animal into the water.\\n“Why did you do that?” demanded Honda, frowning at his friend’s offhandedness.

Then\\nwhen the innkeeper told him that she was still ill, his suspicions were aroused.\\nHounded by wild desperation, he went to Azabu alone one night and walked aimlessly\\naround the streets near the Ayakura mansion. When he passed underneath the light of\\nthe gas lamps in Toriizaka, he stretched out his hands. He was shaken to see how pale\\ntheir backs looked, for he remembered once hearing that invalids near to death look at\\ntheir hands constantly.\\nThe gate in front of the Ayakura mansion was shut fast. The faint light above it was\\nscarcely enough to read even the lettering of the weather-beaten nameplate that loomed\\nup out of the darkness. This house was always poorly lit. He knew that there would be no\\nchance of seeing a light in Satoko’s room from the street.\\nHe looked at the latticed windows of the empty lodges that flanked the gate. He\\nremembered how he and Satoko had stolen in there as children, and become frightened\\nby the gloom and smell of mold in the deserted rooms. Yearning for the sunlight outside,\\nthey had rushed to the windows and grasped the wooden latticework covered with dust.\\nThe same layer of dust was still there. The leaves of the trees around the house opposite\\nhad been so lush and green that it must have happened in May. Close-worked as the\\nlattice was, it had not shut out this greenery, perhaps because the two young faces\\npeering through it were so small. Just then, a man selling seedlings had gone by, and the\\ntwo of them, giggling to themselves, had mimicked him as he cried “Morning glories,\\neggplants,” comically dragging out the syllables.\\nHe had learned much in this house. The smell of ink used in calligraphy invariably had\\nmelancholy associations for him. Melancholy, in fact, was inseparably bound up with the\\nelegance that had become part of him. All of the beautiful things that the Count had\\nshown him—sutras copied in gold on purple scrolls, screens with the autumn flower\\ndesign favored in the imperial palaces in Kyoto—must have emitted a bright ray of carnal\\ndesire, he now realized, but in the Ayakura mansion the smell of ink and mold had lain\\nheavy on everything. But now, within these walls that shut him out tonight, that elegance\\nand seductive brilliance had come to life again after the lapse of many years. And he was\\ncompletely cut off from it.\\nA faint light went out on the second floor of the house, which was fairly visible from the\\nstreet. Perhaps Count and Countess Ayakura had gone to sleep.

Its sultry torpor, only aggravated by the breeze\\nstirred at his back by Tadeshina’s fan, seemed to the Count to equal that of a rice-\\nsteaming basket. The saké had begun to take effect; the Count heard the drumming of\\nthe rain outside as if it were striking the back of his skull; the world outside was lost in\\ninnocent thoughts of victory in war. And thus the Count sat looking down at the erotic\\nscroll. Suddenly Kitazaki’s hands flashed through the air to clap together on a mosquito.\\nHe apologized at once for the disturbance of the noise, and the Count caught a glimpse of\\nthe tiny black smudge of crushed mosquito in his dry white palm, together with a red\\nsmear of blood, an unclean image that unsettled him. Why had the mosquito not bitten\\nhim? Was he really so well protected from everything?\\nThe first picture on the scroll was that of an abbot in a brown robe and a young widow\\nseated facing each other in front of a screen. The style was that of haiku illustrations,\\ndone with a light, humorous touch. The face of the abbot was drawn in caricature to look\\nlike a large penis.\\nIn the next picture the abbot sprang upon the young widow without warning, intent on\\nraping her, and although she was putting up a fight, her kimono was already in disarray.\\nIn the next they were locked in a naked embrace and the woman’s expression was now\\nblissfully relaxed. The abbot’s penis was like the twisted root of a giant pine, and his\\nbrown tongue stuck out in great delight. In accordance with this artistic tradition, the\\nyoung widow’s feet and toes were painted with Chinese white, and curved sharply\\ninward. Tremors ran the length of her white, clinging thighs and ended finally at her toes,\\nas though the tension there embodied her straining effort to hold back the flood of\\necstasy that was about to gush out into eternity. The woman’s exertions were altogether\\nadmirable, thought the Count.\\nOn the other side of the screen, meantime, a number of novice monks were standing\\non a wooden drum and a writing table, and boosting one another onto their shoulders,\\ndesperately keen to see what was going on behind the screen while simultaneously\\nengaged in a comic struggle to keep down those parts of their anatomy that had already\\nswollen to massive proportions. Finally the screen fell over. And as the stark-naked\\nwoman attempted to cover herself and escape, and the abbot lay exhausted with no\\nstrength left to reprimand the novices, a scene of total disorder began to unfold.\\nThe monks’ penises were drawn to appear nearly as long as their owners were tall, the\\nusual proportions being inadequate for the artist to convey the magnitude of their burden\\nof lust. As they set upon the woman, the face of each of them was a comic study in\\nindescribable anguish, and they staggered about under the weight of their own erections.\\nAfter such punishing toil, the woman’s entire body turned deathly pale and she died.\\nHer soul flew out of her and took refuge in the branches of a willow tree blown by the\\nwind.

The ghosts crowded the deck, hair streaming in the wind, pale\\nhands waving derisively, their vaginal faces mocking the wretched cries of their victims on\\nthe shore. The prow of the boat, too, was carved in the form of a vulva, and as it pointed\\ntoward deep water, a tuft of hair clinging to it waved in the sea breeze.\\n∗\\nWhen he finally looked up from the scroll, the Count felt inexplicably depressed. The\\nsaké, far from soothing him, had only increased his feelings of apprehension. But he had\\nKitazaki bring more of it, and drank it in silence. His mind was still filled with the vivid\\nimage of the woman in the scroll, her toes bent inward. The lewd whiteness of her\\npainted legs still flashed before his eyes.\\nWhat he did next could only have been due to the languid heat of that night in the\\nrainy season and to his own disgust. Fourteen years before that wet evening, when his\\nwife had been pregnant with Satoko, he had favored Tadeshina with his attentions. Since\\neven then she had been past forty, this had been an extraordinary whim, and did not last\\nlong. Fourteen years later, with Tadeshina well into her fifties, he never dreamed that\\nanything of the sort would happen again. At any rate, because of what took place this\\ntime, he was never to set foot across the threshold of Kitazaki’s inn again.\\nEvents and circumstances—the Marquis’s visit, the crushing blow to his pride, the rainy\\nnight, the isolated rear parlor of Kitazaki’s house, the saké, the sinister pornography—all\\ncrowded in on the Count, intensifying his mood of resentment and (it could hardly have\\nbeen otherwise) inflaming him with a desire to debase himself, which drove him to do\\nwhat he did. Tadeshina’s response, devoid of any reproach, set the seal on his feelings of\\nself-loathing.\\n“This woman,” he thought, “she’ll wait fourteen, twenty, a hundred years—it makes no\\ndifference to her. And no matter when she hears the voice of her master, she’ll never be\\ncaught unawares.”\\nThrough circumstances which had been none of his doing, he was driven by his\\nseething resentment to plunge into a dark wood where the ghost from the pornographic\\nscroll was lying in wait for him. Moreover, Tadeshina’s unruffled composure, her\\ndeferential flirting, the evident pride she took in her exhaustive knowledge of sexual\\ntechnique, all worked on him just as coercively as they had fourteen years earlier.\\nPerhaps there had been some collusion between her and Kitazaki who left the room\\nand did not return. Afterwards, in the darkness, shut in by the pervasive sound of falling\\nrain, neither of them spoke.

He felt the need to unburden himself of the\\nanger that was devouring him, and he gave Tadeshina a detailed account of something\\nthat belonged to a sphere from which servants were excluded. For he felt that his anger\\nwas not merely his alone, but rather an emotion that incorporated the wrath of his\\nancestors.\\nMarquis Matsugae had paid a visit that day. And when Satoko had come into the room\\nto pay her respects, he had stroked her bobbed hair. And then perhaps under the\\ninfluence of the sake he had drunk, he spoke abruptly in front of the child: “What a\\nbeautiful little princess you have become! When you grow up, you will be so beautiful\\nthat nobody will find words to describe you. And as for finding a handsome husband, you\\njust leave that to Uncle, and don’t worry about a thing. If you trust Uncle completely, I’ll\\nget you a bridegroom without equal anywhere in the world. Your father won’t have a\\nthing to worry about. I’ll line up a trousseau on golden satin for you when you become a\\nbride. What a long, long, proud procession that will be!—such as has never been seen in\\nall the generations of Ayakuras.”\\nThe Countess had given the slightest of frowns at that moment, but the Count had\\nmerely smiled. Instead of smiling in the face of humiliation, his ancestors would have\\nrevealed just enough of their elegance, and struck back. But these days—when, for\\nexample, the ancestral game of \\nkemari\\n was no more than a memory—there were no\\nmeans left to dazzle the vulgar. And when such men as this imposter, overflowing with\\ngoodwill and innocent of any intention to wound a genuine aristocrat, offered their\\nunwitting insults, there was nothing to do but laugh vaguely. However, there was a\\nfaintly mysterious element lingering in the smile that came to the lips of the cultured\\nwhen confronted with the new ascendancy of money and power.\\nThe Count had remained silent for a while after telling Tadeshina all this. If elegance\\nwas to have its revenge, he was thinking, how was it to be accomplished? Wasn’t there a\\nrevenge proper to court nobles, like the revenge in which incense was inserted into the\\nflowing sleeve of a court robe and allowed to burn slowly to a fine ash while showing\\nhardly a trace of flame? A revenge such as this, that would leave a subtle, fragrant poison\\npermeating the material, so that its potency would remain undiminished down the years?\\nAt last the Count turned to Tadeshina and said: “I am going to ask you, long in\\nadvance, to do something.

And\\nthere’s one more aspect to it: since you are the equivalent of a master of arts in all\\nsexual matters, it’s not asking too much, is it, for you to instruct Satoko thoroughly in two\\nrather different accomplishments?

And the second, on the contrary, is to make him think that she’s\\nalready lost her virginity when in fact she has not.”\\n“You need say no more, master,” Tadeshina replied, her voice betraying no sign of\\nhesitation or dismay. “There are such effective techniques with regard to both that there\\nis no danger of arousing the suspicions of even the most experienced and libertine\\ngentlemen. And so I will take great pains to educate Miss Satoko in them.

Instead of a simple “As the\\nmaster wishes,” she undertook her appointed task with a grave and formal agreement.\\n∗\\nAnd Tadeshina was now alluding to what had happened that night eight years before.\\nThe Count was only too aware of what she wanted to say.

The\\nprospective bridegroom had turned out to be a prince of the Imperial Family, and\\nalthough credit was due to the Marquis, a marriage as fortunate as this would mean the\\nresurgence of the House of Ayakura. In short, the circumstances were very different from\\nthose he had envisaged eight years before when he had given Tadeshina his instructions\\nin a burning rage.

Her voice\\nsounded almost cheerful, but it was a trifle shrill.\\nInevitably there ensued a hurried conversation between him and his mother, consisting\\nof the usual admonitions and good wishes exchanged between mother and son before\\nshe goes off, leaving him behind. He wondered at the skill he was able to bring to\\nsupporting his role in this little skit.\\nWhen he had finally freed himself from his mother, he turned to the Countess and\\nquickly ran through the correct formulas of farewell with her. Then, as though nothing\\ncould be more casual, he said to Satoko, “Well, take care of yourself now.” At that\\nmoment he felt able to lend lightness to his words, and this was reflected in an impulse\\nto put out his hand and lay it on her shoulder.

She had\\nconcluded that, given the circumstances, there was no other way to discharge her loyalty\\nto the Emperor. She had happened to uncover a plot directed at him, and she could not\\nallow it to proceed unchecked.

She had not expected the Abbess to grant her request so\\nreadily. She had had an encounter with the Lord Buddha, and the Abbess, her eye as\\nkeen as a crane’s, had immediately discerned the firmness of the girl’s decision.\\nAlthough it was customary for a novice to undergo a year of ascetic discipline before\\nher formal induction as a nun, both Satoko and the Abbess felt that in the present\\ncircumstances this period should be dispensed with.

The distinctive character of Hosso Buddhism was in\\nplacing greater emphasis on the cultivation of the mind than the practice of religious\\nausterities. Gesshu Temple, furthermore, was traditionally dedicated to praying for the\\nwelfare of the whole nation, and there were no households registered with it as\\nparishioners. Sometimes the Abbess would observe with gentle humor that the “Grace of\\ntears” was something never encountered in Hosso Buddhism, thus underlining the\\ncontrast with the more recently arisen Amida cult of Pure Land Buddhism, with its great\\nstress on ecstatic prayers of gratitude.\\nThen, too, in Mahayana Buddhism in general, there were no precepts to speak of. But\\nfor the rules of its monastic life the precepts of Hinayana Buddhism were often borrowed.\\nIn convents such as Gesshu, however, the rule was the “Precepts of a Bodhisattva”\\ncontained in the \\nBrahamajala Sutra.\\n Its forty-eight prohibitions began with ten major\\ninjunctions against such sins as the taking of life, stealing, excess of any sort, and lying,\\nand it concluded with an admonishment against destroying Buddhist teachings.\\nFar more severe than any commandment, however, was the monastic training. In the\\nbrief time she had been at Gesshu, Satoko had already memorized both the “Sutra of the\\nEnlightened Heart” and the “Thirty Verses” expounding the doctrine of \\nYuishiki.\\n Each\\nmorning she got up early to sweep and dust the main hall of worship before the Abbess\\ncame for her morning devotions, in the course of which she then had an opportunity to\\npractice the chanting of the sutras.

Then he outlined the strategy they were to follow. They\\nwould present the Toinnomiyas with a certificate signed by a reputable doctor testifying\\nthat Satoko had been stricken by a severe nervous breakdown. The shared responsibility\\nof preserving this secret might unite the Toinnomiyas with the Ayakuras and Matsugaes\\nin mutual trust, and this might soften the Prince’s anger. As for the general public, all that\\nneed be done was to spread the rumor that the Toinnomiyas had released a curt, vaguely\\nworded statement that the engagement was at an end and that Satoko had turned her\\nback on the world and fled to a convent. As a result of this inversion of cause and effect,\\nthe Toinnomiyas, although obliged to some extent to play the villain, would nonetheless\\nmaintain face and prestige. And the Ayakuras, while incurring a measure of shame, would\\nnevertheless benefit from public sympathy.\\nIt would never do, however, to let things get out of hand. If that were to happen,\\naltogether too much sympathy would accrue to the Ayakuras, and the Toinnomiyas, faced\\nwith the stirrings of unjustified hostility, would be compelled to clarify matters, and so\\nhave to make public Satoko’s medical certificate.

What\\nparticularly provoked him was the look that he was sure he had caught in the Marquis’s\\neyes: a flicker of presumption that his signature would indeed be forthcoming.\\n“What’s the meaning of this preposterous request?” he demanded. “Do you by any\\nchance take me for one of your society doctors who can be bought and paid for?”\\n“Believe me, Doctor,” the Marquis replied, “we have by no means mistaken you for a\\ngentleman of that sort.” He took his cigar out of his mouth and began to pace the room.\\nThen, gazing across at the doctor and noting how his plump, healthy ruddy cheeks were\\nquivering in the firelight, he addressed him in a deep, solemn tone: “As for this medical\\ncertificate, it is something that is essential to the continued tranquillity of His Sacred\\nMajesty.”\\n∗\\nWhen the Marquis had the signed certificate in his hand, he at once requested a\\nmeeting with Prince Toin at his earliest convenience, and went next night to the Prince’s\\nresidence.\\nFortunately enough, the young prince was away again on regimental maneuvers.

Kiyoaki was surprised to find that even the sons of the\\nmost prestigious families at Peers were so much in the dark over this event that some of\\nthem asked him, of all people, what he thought of the affair.\\n“Everybody’s so sympathetic toward the Ayakuras, but do you know what I think?” one\\nstudent demanded. “I think that this is going to undermine people’s reverence for the\\nImperial Family. Isn’t everybody saying that they found out later that this Miss Ayakura\\nwasn’t quite right in her mind?

Why don’t you stop gossiping like a schoolgirl?”\\nBut this kind of appeal to masculinity was ineffective at Peers. To begin with, Honda’s\\nfamily did not have the status to qualify him as a person in the know, who could provide\\na plausible ending to this sort of exchange. In order to qualify as a person in the know,\\none had to be able to say something like: “She happens to be my cousin,” or perhaps,\\n“He is the son of my uncle’s mistress.” A boy such as this had to show that he was proud\\nto have faint blood ties to crime and scandal, and yet at the same time parade his own\\nnoble aloofness intact. And so with a slight curl to his lip, he would drop enough of a hint\\nto indicate that, unlike the rumormongering rabble, he had access to behind-the-scenes\\ninformation. At this school, mere boys of fifteen or sixteen were apt to put on airs and\\nsay: “It’s given the Home Minister quite a headache, you know. He called up late last\\nnight to talk to Father about it”; or again: “Everyone thinks that the Home Minister is laid\\nup with a cold, but the truth is that he was in such a hurry to get to an imperial audience\\nthat he missed the step getting out of his carriage and sprained his ankle.”\\nStrangely enough, Kiyoaki’s habitual secretiveness seemed to have worked to his\\nadvantage in this business.

Half his hair\\nhad fallen out. His complexion was ashen and his skin lackluster. His back was hunched.\\nNo one knew what his eyes were like because he kept them well covered with the peak\\nof his school cap which he had special permission to wear even in the classroom. He\\nsniveled constantly, and made a noise like water at a low boil. As he never talked to\\nanyone, he would take a book during recess and walk to the far edge of the lawn in front\\nof the school before he sat down to read it.\\nKiyoaki too, of course, had never had anything at all to do with this student, who,\\nbesides everything else, was in a different course. Even though their fathers were nobles\\nof the same rank, Kiyoaki seemed to embody beauty more than any other boy in the\\nschool, whereas the other was like the chosen emissary of ugliness and sinister shadow.\\nAlthough the dry grass in the corner of the lawn that was the Monster’s chosen spot\\ncaught more than its fair share of sun on this particular early winter day, everyone else\\navoided it. When Kiyoaki came up and sat down beside him, he shut his book and went\\ntense as he prepared to flee, as he always did. Only the muffled sound of his sniveling,\\nlike the steady dragging of a light chain, broke the silence.\\n“What’s that you’re always reading?” asked the Marquis’s son who was beautiful.\\n“Nothing . . . ,” replied the Marquis’s son who was ugly. He thrust the book behind him,\\nbut not before Kiyoaki’s eye caught the name Leopardi printed on the spine. The gilt\\nlettering cast a faint reflection that flashed over the dry grass and was gone.\\nSince the Monster was not disposed to talk, Kiyoaki edged away from him without\\ngetting up, then stretched out his legs and lay on his side, supporting himself on one\\nelbow and ignoring the numerous blades of dry grass now clinging to his woolen uniform.\\nStill directly opposite him, the Monster sat huddled in obvious distress, shutting the book\\nthat he had once more spread out in front of him. Kiyoaki felt that he was looking at a\\ncaricature of his own misery, and his gentleness began to give way to indignation. As the\\nunseasonably warm sun continued its prodigality regardless, Kiyoaki saw the ugly figure\\nof the Marquis’s son begin to undergo a gradual transformation. His crumpled legs\\ncautiously stretched out as he lay down on the grass and propped himself on his elbow\\nopposite Kiyoaki. His form became Kiyoaki’s own, down to the very angle of the head and\\nthe set of the shoulders. They had become as like as a pair of lion-dogs guarding a\\ntemple gate.

Any\\nmarriage involving a member of the Imperial Family had to be subjected to close scrutiny\\nin accordance with the provisions of the Imperial Household Code because such a\\nmarriage, no matter how remote the possibility, might affect the imperial succession.\\nThese then were the grave circumstances under which Marquis Matsugae had taken it\\nupon himself to sponsor the daughter of an ancient family, a girl whose mental instability\\nhe claimed to have been unaware of at the time, going so far as to obtain an imperial\\nsanction for her marriage, only to have his plans fall through, almost on the eve of the\\nbetrothal ceremony. Despite all this, however, simply by being lucky enough to have\\nsucceeded in keeping his name out of the affair, Marquis Matsugae today was going\\ntranquilly about his business, thus displaying not only a brazen disloyalty to His Majesty\\nthe Emperor, but also a lack of reverence toward his own father, one of the pillars of the\\nMeiji Restoration.\\nIf the article provoked the Marquis to fury, it aroused misgivings in his son. He noticed\\nat once that Iinuma had made a point of appending his name and address to it and also\\nthat, although he was fully aware of what had happened between Kiyoaki and Satoko, he\\nhad written as though he really believed Satoko had had a nervous breakdown. Up to\\nthen, Kiyoaki had had no idea where he was living. And now the thought struck him that\\nIinuma had written this in the knowledge that he would incur the stigma of someone\\ndead to all sense of obligation, because he had wanted Kiyoaki to read it at all costs and\\nknow where he was, without seeming to inform him directly. At any rate, he was sure\\nthat the article contained a hidden message that was aimed at him alone: Don’t be like\\nyour father.\\nAll at once, he felt a rush of nostalgia at the thought of Iinuma. To have his awkward\\ndevotion once more, to mock it playfully—he could think of nothing that would cheer him\\nmore in his present mood.

But since to gratify one family would be to disappoint\\nthe other, the Marquis made it a practice to accept neither invitation, but rather to send\\nover presents for each family’s children. This year, however, feeling that he might find\\nsomething to divert him in the holiday mood of a foreign household, Kiyoaki asked his\\nmother if she would intercede with his father to let him go. But the Marquis would not\\nhear of it.\\nThe reason he gave was not the usual one of being unwilling to disappoint one family\\nor the other. Instead he said that it was beneath the dignity of the son of the nobility to\\naccept an invitation from a tenant family. One of the implications in this was clear enough\\nto Kiyoaki: his father still had little faith in his son’s ability to maintain his dignity.\\nThe Matsugae household was in a flurry of activity during the last days of the year, as\\nthe traditional massive house-cleaning that preceded the New Year’s holidays could not\\nbe completed in a single day. Kiyoaki had nothing to do.

A reflected gleam raced crookedly across the\\ntangled reeds.\\nHe looked down at the cold image of clouds and blue sky reflected in the surface of the\\nwater, and wondered at the sluggish ripples stirred by his oars.

Ever since Kiyoaki was fifteen, Count Ayakura had\\nsent him an invitation each year without fail, a kind of abiding token of the training in\\nelegance he had once received from the Count. And this year too, though one would\\nhardly have been surprised if it had been otherwise, an invitation came as usual through\\nthe Imperial Household Ministry. The Count was going to assume his role as an imperial\\nlector once again, unhindered by any shameful scruples, and it was clearly he who had\\narranged Kiyoaki’s invitation.\\nWhen he showed his father the invitation, the Marquis frowned at the sight of the\\nCount’s signature among those of the four lectors.

In essence, we\\nare not supposed to have any connection with them where that affair is concerned.”\\nYear by year the poetry ceremony had grown on Kiyoaki, and he had come to\\nappreciate it greatly. At no other time did the dignity of Count Ayakura’s bearing show to\\nsuch advantage as it did on these occasions, nor could Kiyoaki imagine any role more\\nsuited to him. Now of course, the sight of the Count would be a painful one, but even so\\nhe felt that he wanted to see him. He felt the desire to take a steady look at the\\nshattered fragments of a poem that had once been alive inside him too, until he had\\ngrown weary of looking. He thought that if he attended, the image of Satoko would fill his\\nmind.\\nHe no longer believed himself to be a thorn of elegance jabbed into the sturdy fingers\\nof the Matsugaes. But he had not changed to the point of thinking that he actually was\\none of those fingers either. Only the elegance that had been so conscious a part of him\\nhad withered. His heart had become desolate. Nowhere in himself could he find the kind\\nof graceful sorrow that inspires poems. He was empty now, his soul a desert swept by\\nparching winds. He had never felt more estranged from elegance and from beauty as\\nwell.\\nYet perhaps all this was essential to his attaining true beauty—this inner emptiness,\\nthis loss of all joy, even this utter inability to believe that the oppressive weight of each\\nmoment was something real, that his pain, at least, was something that was his.

So he caught a turtle from the pond and prepared it\\nfor you.”\\nAs he felt the unpleasantly smooth liquid sliding down his throat, he remembered the\\nstory the servants had so often used to frighten him when he was a child. Once again he\\nsaw the disturbing picture he had formed at that time of a snapping turtle raising its head\\nlike a sinister ghost from the dark waters of the pond, its eyes fixed on him, a creature\\nthat usually lay buried in the warm mud on the bottom, but never failed to force its way\\nup to the surface time and again, pushing through the hostile weeds of dreams that\\nconquered time, to fix its eyes on him at every stage of his life.

The policeman then said that Kiyoaki was from an\\nextremely exalted family. He was therefore to be treated with the utmost deference, but\\non no account was he to learn of the policeman’s visit.

All by himself, with no one’s help, he\\nhad to demonstrate the purity of his devotion. On looking back, he realized that up to\\nnow he had not even once had the opportunity of proving this devotion to Satoko. Or\\nperhaps, he thought, his cowardice had made him flee any such opportunity until now.\\nToday, there was only one thing for him to do. To go out, ill as he was, to risk worse\\nillness, was a significantly great penance. Devotion so overwhelming might stir a\\nresponse from Satoko, or then again it might not.

In the meantime, however, his heart had\\nformed another resolution of its own, that overrode his intentions and desires.\\nThe only force to counter this wayward urge in his heart was his body itself.

It kept falling noiselessly, but was not enough to cover the ground. Even the\\nflakes that fell on his blanket vanished without leaving obvious drops of moisture.\\nHe saw the flat white of the sky grow gradually brighter until a pale sun at last shone\\nthrough the clouds. The falling snow blended into this new brightness more and more,\\nuntil it was like a fine white ash floating in the air.\\nAll along the road, the tall, dry grass swayed in the light wind, its feathery plumes\\nhaving a faint glint of silver in the cold sunlight.

The world\\naround him was absolutely still. The swaying of the rickshaw and the heaviness of his\\neyelids may well have confused what he saw out there, but whatever the incidental\\ndistortion, this was a clear enough confrontation.

Would letting him see Satoko for just a moment or two be\\nquite outside the scope of the Lord Buddha’s compassion? Won’t you please permit it?”\\nHer Reverence still did not answer. Although he was completely wrought up, he\\nstopped there, afraid that if he said anything further his words would only make it less\\nlikely that the Abbess would change her mind. The chilly room was hushed. The light that\\nfiltered through the pure white paper of the latticework doors made Honda think of a thin\\nmist.\\nAt that moment he thought he heard something. It was not by any means so close as\\nto be in the next room, but close enough, coming perhaps from a corner of the hallway or\\nfrom the next room but one. It sounded like a muffled laugh, as faint as the opening of a\\nplum blossom. But then after a moment’s reflection, he was sure that unless his ears had\\ndeceived him, the sound that had carried to him through the chill convent atmosphere on\\nthis spring morning was not a muffled laugh, as he had thought, but a young woman’s\\nstifled sob.

But then he began to wonder if it was no more than a momentary quirk of his\\nimagination.\\n“Ah,” said the Abbess, breaking her silence at last, “no doubt you think me unduly\\nsevere. You may feel that I am the one who is using every means to keep these two\\napart. However, surely it may well be that some superhuman agency is at work here. It\\nbegan when Satoko herself made a vow before the Lord Buddha. She swore never to\\nmeet this man again in this world. I therefore think that the Lord Buddha in his wisdom is\\nmaking sure that she does not. But for the young master, what a tragedy it is.”\\n“Despite everything then, Your Reverence will not give permission?”\\n“No.”\\nHer voice had an inexpressible dignity, and he felt quite powerless to answer her. The\\nsimple \\nno\\n seemed powerful enough to tear apart the very sky like fragile silk.\\nAfter that, seeing his deep distress, the Abbess’s beautiful voice began to direct an\\nexalted monologue at him. Although he was by no means eager to leave and have to\\nface Kiyoaki’s dejection, his distress prevented him from paying more than half-hearted\\nattention to what she was saying.\\nThe Abbess referred to the net of Indra. Indra was an Indian God, and once he cast his\\nnet, every man, every living thing without exception was inextricably caught in its\\nmeshes. And so it was that all creatures in existence were inescapably bound by it.\\nIndra’s net symbolized the Chain of Causation or, in Sanskrit, \\npratitya-samutpada.\\nYuishiki\\n (Vijñaptimãtrata or Consciousness), the fundamental doctrine of the Hosso Sect,\\nto which Gesshu belonged, was celebrated in \\nThe Thirty Verses of Yuishiki\\n, the canonical\\ntext attributed to Vasubandhu, whom the sect regarded as its founder. According to the\\nVerses, \\nAlaya\\n is the origin of the Chain of Causation. This was a Sanskrit word that\\ndenoted a storehouse. For within the \\nAlaya\\n were contained the karmic “seeds” that held\\nthe consequential effects of all deeds, both good and evil.\\nDeeper within man than the first six forms of consciousness—sight, hearing, smell,\\ntaste, touch, and mind, with which sentient beings are endowed—there was a seventh\\ncalled \\nMana\\n or self-awareness. But \\nAlaya\\n, the ultimate form of consciousness lay deeper\\nyet.\\nJust as \\nThe Thirty Verses\\n expressed it, “Like unto a violent torrent, ever flowing, ever\\nchanging,” this eighth form of awareness, like a raging river, changed incessantly, never\\nceasing to flow onward. In constant flux, \\nAlaya\\n is the source of all sentient beings and the\\nsum of all effects on them.\\nAsanga, the co-founder along with Vasubandhu of the Yuishiki school, in a doctrinal\\nwork called \\nThe Providence of the Greater Vehicle\\n, evolved, on the basis of the eternally\\nmutative nature of \\nAlaya\\n, a unique theory of the Chain of Causation in terms of time. It\\ndealt with the interaction of the \\nAlaya\\n consciousness and the Law of Defilement that gave\\nrise to what was termed “the ever-recurring cycle of annihilation and renewal of\\ncausality.” According to the doctrine of \\nYuishiki\\n, “awareness only,” each of the various\\ndharmas, which were actually nothing other than consciousness, far from enjoying\\npermanence, existed purely for the moment. And once the instant was past, they were'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'calibre 1.43.0 [http://calibre-ebook.com]', 'creator': 'calibre 1.43.0 [http://calibre-ebook.com]', 'creationdate': '2014-09-08T21:10:44+00:00', 'author': 'Yukio Mishima', 'title': 'Spring Snow', 'source': '../data/pdfFiles/Spring Snow - Yukio Mishima.pdf', 'total_pages': 273, 'page': 268, 'page_label': '269'}, page_content='annihilated. At the present moment, the \\nAlaya\\n consciousness and the Law of Defilement\\nexist simultaneously, and their interaction gives rise to the causality of the present\\nmoment. Once this moment is past, both \\nAlaya\\n and the Law of Defilement are\\nannihilated, but with the next moment, both are reborn, and both once again interact to\\ngive rise to a new causality. Beings in existence thus are annihilated from moment to\\nmoment, and this gives rise to time. The process whereby time is engendered by this\\nmoment-to-moment annihilation may be likened to a row of dots and a line.\\n∗\\nAs the minutes passed, Honda gradually found himself being drawn into the Abbess’s\\nprofound doctrinal exposition. But his present circumstances prevented any stirring of his\\ninstinctive spirit of rational inquiry. The sudden burst of complex Buddhist terminology put\\nhim off, and then there were many difficult points over which he had doubts. Karma, he\\nthought, should operate eternally, a process without beginning, that by its nature\\ncontained within itself elements of time. It seemed contradictory to him that, on the\\ncontrary, time was to be understood as arising from the dissolution and regeneration of\\neach present moment’s causality.\\nHis various misgivings thus prevented him from giving wholeheartedly respectful\\nattention to Her Reverence’s learned discourse. The old nun also irritated him with her\\ninterjections. At appropriate intervals, she would chime in with “How very true!” . . .\\n“Indeed, just so!” . . . “How could it be otherwise?” and the like. So he contented himself\\nby memorizing the titles of \\nThe Thirty Verses\\n and \\nThe Providence of the Greater Vehicle\\nand thought that he could look into them when he had the leisure and then come back\\nhere to ask questions. Given his present mood, then, he did not realize from what\\nperspective and with what clarity the Abbess’s words were illuminating Kiyoaki’s fate as\\nwell as his own, though on the face of it they might seem remote and irrelevant. It was\\njust the same way that the moon, at its zenith, subtly lights up the dark waters of a lake.\\nHe murmured a polite farewell and took his leave of Gesshu as quickly as he could.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'calibre 1.43.0 [http://calibre-ebook.com]', 'creator': 'calibre 1.43.0 [http://calibre-ebook.com]', 'creationdate': '2014-09-08T21:10:44+00:00', 'author': 'Yukio Mishima', 'title': 'Spring Snow', 'source': '../data/pdfFiles/Spring Snow - Yukio Mishima.pdf', 'total_pages': 273, 'page': 269, 'page_label': '270'}, page_content='55\\n \\n D\\nURING THE TRAIN RIDE\\n back to Tokyo, Kiyoaki’s all too evident pain was\\na constant source of distress to Honda. He put aside his books entirely, his sole concern\\nnow to get his friend home as soon as possible. As he looked down at Kiyoaki lying\\ngravely ill on his berth, being carried back to Tokyo without having achieved the meeting\\nhe had so desired, he felt a gnawing regret. He was now wondering if it had really been\\nthe act of a friend to give him that money.\\nKiyoaki had fallen into a doze. Honda, on the other hand, was more alert than ever,\\ndespite having gone without sleep for so long. He allowed a multitude of thoughts to\\ncome and go unchecked. Among these, the memory of the Abbess’s sermons on two\\noccasions came to him, each with an entirely different effect. In the autumn of the\\nprevious year, he had heard his first sermon from her, the parable of drinking the water\\nfrom the skull. He had taken that principle and made a parable of his own from it, one\\ndealing with human love. And he had concluded by thinking that it would unquestionably\\nbe wonderful if a man could really make the substance of the world truly conform to that\\nof his innermost heart. Later, in the course of his legal studies, he had given considerable\\nthought to the doctrine of reincarnation as expressed in the Laws of Manu. And this\\nmorning, he had heard the Abbess speak again. He now felt as though the only key to the\\nriddle that had been vexing him had dangled momentarily on a cord before his eyes,\\nswinging back and forth with so many confusing jumps and twists that the riddle itself\\nseemed to have become all the more complex.\\nThe train was due at Shimbashi Station at six in the morning. The night was already\\nwell advanced. The heavy breathing of the passengers mingled with the rumble of the\\nwheels. He would stay awake until dawn, watching Kiyoaki in the lower berth directly\\nopposite him. He had left the curtains open so that he would know at once if there was\\nany change at all in Kiyoaki’s condition, and now he stared out of the window at the fields\\nclothed in darkness.\\nThough the train was racing through the night, the darkness was so thick and the sky\\nso overcast that the fields and mountains beyond were almost blotted out, leaving nearly\\nnothing to mark the forward progress of the train. From time to time, a tiny flash of light\\nor the brief glow of a lantern tore a brilliant rent in the curtain of blackness, but these\\ncould not provide any orientation. It was not the train that made this rumbling noise,\\nHonda mused. It was something else. Something that enveloped this little thing as it\\nmade its insignificant way through the night. The roaring issued from the massive\\ndarkness itself.\\nWhile Honda had been hurriedly packing to leave the inn at Obitoké, Kiyoaki had'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'calibre 1.43.0 [http://calibre-ebook.com]', 'creator': 'calibre 1.43.0 [http://calibre-ebook.com]', 'creationdate': '2014-09-08T21:10:44+00:00', 'author': 'Yukio Mishima', 'title': 'Spring Snow', 'source': '../data/pdfFiles/Spring Snow - Yukio Mishima.pdf', 'total_pages': 273, 'page': 270, 'page_label': '271'}, page_content='obtained a few sheets of cheap stationery from the innkeeper and had written a note\\nwhich he had then given to Honda, asking him to deliver it to his mother the Marquise.\\nHonda had placed it carefully in the inside pocket of his jacket. Now, for want of anything\\nbetter to do, he took it out and read it by the poor light of the bulb hanging from the roof\\nof the car.\\nIt was written in pencil, and the hand was unsteady, quite unlike Kiyoaki. He had never\\ndrawn his figures with much grace, but there had always been an abundantly vigorous\\ntouch to them:\\nDear Mother,\\nThere is something that I would like you to give Honda for me. The dream journal in my\\ndesk. He’d like it. And since nobody else would want to read it, please see that he gets it.\\nKiyoaki\\nHonda could see that he had used his last reserves of strength to write this as a kind of\\nwill. But if it really had been that, he should surely have included a word or two for his\\nmother herself, instead of addressing her in this curt and businesslike fashion.\\nA groan came from the opposite berth. He quickly put away the note and was beside\\nKiyoaki in a flash, looking down at his face.\\n“What is it?”\\n“My chest hurts. It feels as if I’m being stabbed here.”\\nKiyoaki’s breathing was harsh. His words came in spurts. Honda, not knowing what else\\nto do, gently began to massage the lower left side of his chest, the spot where he said\\nthe pain was most intense. But in the faint light, he saw that his friend’s face was still\\ncontorted.\\nDespite the contortions, however, it was beautiful. Intense suffering had imbued it with\\nan extraordinary character, carving lines into it that gave it the austere dignity of a\\nbronze mask. The beautiful eyes were filled with tears. Above them, however, the\\neyebrows were tightly puckered, and the masculine force they conveyed made a striking\\ncontrast with the pathos of the flashing dark, wet pupils. As he fought the pain, his finely\\nchiseled nose jutted upward as if he were trying to probe the darkness around him, and\\nhis lips, parched with fever, were drawn back to reveal the palely gleaming mother-of-\\npearl of his teeth.\\nFinally, the racking pain seemed to subside.\\n“You’re asleep? Good. It’s what you need,” said Honda. He wondered about the\\ntortured look he had seen on his friend’s face just a moment before. Hadn’t it in fact been\\nan expression of intense joy, the kind to be found nowhere but at the extremity of human\\nexistence? Perhaps Kiyoaki had seen something, and Honda envied him that, an emotion\\nthat in turn stirred an odd shame and self-reproach in him.\\nHe shook his head slightly. He had begun to feel the numbing weight of grief. Deep\\nwithin him, as subtly and persistently as the spinning of a silkworm’s thread, an emotion\\nhad gradually taken shape. Its significance eluded him, and he was disturbed by it.\\nThen Kiyoaki, who seemed to have dozed off for a moment, suddenly opened his eyes'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'calibre 1.43.0 [http://calibre-ebook.com]', 'creator': 'calibre 1.43.0 [http://calibre-ebook.com]', 'creationdate': '2014-09-08T21:10:44+00:00', 'author': 'Yukio Mishima', 'title': 'Spring Snow', 'source': '../data/pdfFiles/Spring Snow - Yukio Mishima.pdf', 'total_pages': 273, 'page': 271, 'page_label': '272'}, page_content='wide and reached for Honda’s hand.
